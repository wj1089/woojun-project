3,HELP COMMAND,3,"Syntax:
mysql> help search_string

If you provide an argument to the help command, mysql uses it as a
search string to access server-side help from the contents of the MySQL
Reference Manual. The proper operation of this command requires that
the help tables in the mysql database be initialized with help topic
information (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-side-help-support.html).

If there is no match for the search string, the search fails:

mysql> help me

DATETIME values in 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.fraction]' format, but permits
assignment of values to DATETIME columns using either strings or
numbers.

An optional fsp value in the range from 0 to 6 may be given to specify
fractional seconds precision. A value of 0 signifies that there is no
fractional part. If omitted, the default precision is 0.

Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time for
DATETIME columns can be specified using DEFAULT and ON UPDATE column
definition clauses, as described in

21,TIMESTAMP,2,"TIMESTAMP[(fsp)]

A timestamp. The range is '1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000' UTC to
'2038-01-19 03:14:07.999999' UTC. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the
number of seconds since the epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). A
TIMESTAMP cannot represent the value '1970-01-01 00:00:00' because that
is equivalent to 0 seconds from the epoch and the value 0 is reserved
for representing '0000-00-00 00:00:00', the ""zero"" TIMESTAMP value.

An optional fsp value in the range from 0 to 6 may be given to specify
fractional seconds precision. A value of 0 signifies that there is no
fractional part. If omitted, the default precision is 0.

The way the server handles TIMESTAMP definitions depends on the value
of the explicit_defaults_for_timestamp system variable (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html).

If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, there is no automatic
assignment of the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes to any TIMESTAMP column. They must be
included explicitly in the column definition. Also, any TIMESTAMP not
explicitly declared as NOT NULL permits NULL values.

If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled, the server handles
TIMESTAMP as follows:

Unless specified otherwise, the first TIMESTAMP column in a table is
defined to be automatically set to the date and time of the most recent
modification if not explicitly assigned a value. This makes TIMESTAMP
useful for recording the timestamp of an INSERT or UPDATE operation.
You can also set any TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time by
assigning it a NULL value, unless it has been defined with the NULL
attribute to permit NULL values.

Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can
be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP column definition clauses. By default, the first
TIMESTAMP column has these properties, as previously noted. However,
any TIMESTAMP column in a table can be defined to have these
properties.

assignment of values to TIME columns using either strings or numbers.

23,YEAR DATA TYPE,2,"YEAR[(4)]

A year in 4-digit format. MySQL displays YEAR values in YYYY format,
but permits assignment of values to YEAR columns using either strings
or numbers. Values display as 1901 to 2155, or 0000.

For additional information about YEAR display format and interpretation
of input values, see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/year.html.

*Note*:

As of MySQL 8.0.19, the YEAR(4) data type with an explicit display
width is deprecated and support for it will be removed in a future
MySQL version. Instead, use YEAR without a display width, which has the
same meaning.

MySQL 8.0 does not support the 2-digit YEAR(2) data type permitted in
older versions of MySQL. For instructions on converting to 4-digit
YEAR, see 2-Digit YEAR(2) Limitations and Migrating to 4-Digit YEAR

26,VARCHAR,2,"[NATIONAL] VARCHAR(M) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE
collation_name]

A variable-length string. M represents the maximum column length in
characters. The range of M is 0 to 65,535. The effective maximum length
of a VARCHAR is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is
shared among all columns) and the character set used. For example, utf8
characters can require up to three bytes per character, so a VARCHAR
column that uses the utf8 character set can be declared to be a maximum
of 21,844 characters. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/column-count-limit.html.

MySQL stores VARCHAR values as a 1-byte or 2-byte length prefix plus
data. The length prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A
VARCHAR column uses one length byte if values require no more than 255
bytes, two length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes.

*Note*:

MySQL follows the standard SQL specification, and does not remove
trailing spaces from VARCHAR values.

VARCHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER VARYING. NATIONAL VARCHAR is the
standard SQL way to define that a VARCHAR column should use some
predefined character set. MySQL uses utf8 as this predefined character
set. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-national.html.
NVARCHAR is shorthand for NATIONAL VARCHAR.

40,GEOMETRY HIERARCHY,5,"Geometry is the base class. It is an abstract class. The instantiable
subclasses of Geometry are restricted to zero-, one-, and
two-dimensional geometric objects that exist in two-dimensional
coordinate space. All instantiable geometry classes are defined so that
valid instances of a geometry class are topologically closed (that is,
all defined geometries include their boundary).

The base Geometry class has subclasses for Point, Curve, Surface, and
GeometryCollection:

o Point represents zero-dimensional objects.

o Curve represents one-dimensional objects, and has subclass
  LineString, with sub-subclasses Line and LinearRing.

o Surface is designed for two-dimensional objects and has subclass
  Polygon.

o GeometryCollection has specialized zero-, one-, and two-dimensional
  collection classes named MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and
  MultiPolygon for modeling geometries corresponding to collections of
  Points, LineStrings, and Polygons, respectively. MultiCurve and
  MultiSurface are introduced as abstract superclasses that generalize
  the collection interfaces to handle Curves and Surfaces.

Geometry, Curve, Surface, MultiCurve, and MultiSurface are defined as
noninstantiable classes. They define a common set of methods for their
subclasses and are included for extensibility.

Point, LineString, Polygon, GeometryCollection, MultiPoint,
MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon are instantiable classes.

43,SPATIAL COLUMNS,5,"MySQL provides a standard way of creating spatial columns for geometry
types, for example, with CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE. Spatial columns
are supported for MyISAM, InnoDB, NDB, and ARCHIVE tables. See also the
notes about spatial indexes under [HELP SPATIAL indexes].

Columns with a spatial data type can have an SRID attribute, to
explicitly indicate the spatial reference system (SRS) for values
stored in the column. For implications of an SRID-restricted column,
see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-type-overview.html.

44,SPATIAL INDEXES,5,"For InnoDB and MyISAM tables, MySQL can create spatial indexes using
syntax similar to that for creating regular indexes, but using the
SPATIAL keyword. Columns in spatial indexes must be declared NOT NULL.
The following examples demonstrate how to create spatial indexes:

o With CREATE TABLE:

CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326, SPATIAL INDEX(g));

o With ALTER TABLE:

CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);
ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);

o With CREATE INDEX:

CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);
CREATE SPATIAL INDEX g ON geom (g);

SPATIAL INDEX creates an R-tree index. For storage engines that support
nonspatial indexing of spatial columns, the engine creates a B-tree
index. A B-tree index on spatial values is useful for exact-value
lookups, but not for range scans.

The optimizer can use spatial indexes defined on columns that are
SRID-restricted. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-type-overview.html, and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-index-optimization.html
.

For more information on indexing spatial columns, see [HELP CREATE
INDEX].

To drop spatial indexes, use ALTER TABLE or DROP INDEX:

o With ALTER TABLE:

ALTER TABLE geom DROP INDEX g;

o With DROP INDEX:

DROP INDEX g ON geom;

Example: Suppose that a table geom contains more than 32,000
geometries, which are stored in the column g of type GEOMETRY. The
table also has an AUTO_INCREMENT column fid for storing object ID
values.

CASE value WHEN [compare_value] THEN result [WHEN [compare_value] THEN

CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result [WHEN [condition] THEN result ...]

The first CASE syntax returns the result for the first
value=compare_value comparison that is true. The second syntax returns
the result for the first condition that is true. If no comparison or
condition is true, the result after ELSE is returned, or NULL if there
is no ELSE part.

*Note*:

The syntax of the CASE expr described here differs slightly from that
of the SQL CASE statement described in [HELP CASE statement], for use
inside stored programs. The CASE statement cannot have an ELSE NULL
clause, and it is terminated with END CASE instead of END.

The return type of a CASE expression result is the aggregated type of
all result values:

o If all types are numeric, the aggregated type is also numeric:

  o If at least one argument is double precision, the result is double
    precision.

  o Otherwise, if at least one argument is DECIMAL, the result is
    DECIMAL.

  o Otherwise, the result is an integer type (with one exception):

    o If all integer types are all signed or all unsigned, the result
      is the same sign and the precision is the highest of all
      specified integer types (that is, TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT,
      INT, or BIGINT).

    o If there is a combination of signed and unsigned integer types,
      the result is signed and the precision may be higher. For
      example, if the types are signed INT and unsigned INT, the result
      is signed BIGINT.

    o The exception is unsigned BIGINT combined with any signed integer
      type. The result is DECIMAL with sufficient precision and scale
      0.

o If all types are BIT, the result is BIT. Otherwise, BIT arguments are
  treated similar to BIGINT.

o If all types are YEAR, the result is YEAR. Otherwise, YEAR arguments
  are treated similar to INT.

o If all types are character string (CHAR or VARCHAR), the result is

72,IF FUNCTION,11,"Syntax:
IF(expr1,expr2,expr3)

If expr1 is TRUE (expr1 <> 0 and expr1 <> NULL), IF() returns expr2.
Otherwise, it returns expr3.

*Note*:

There is also an IF statement, which differs from the IF() function
described here. See [HELP IF statement].

If only one of expr2 or expr3 is explicitly NULL, the result type of
the IF() function is the type of the non-NULL expression.

The default return type of IF() (which may matter when it is stored
into a temporary table) is calculated as follows:

o If expr2 or expr3 produce a string, the result is a string.

  If expr2 and expr3 are both strings, the result is case-sensitive if
  either string is case sensitive.

o If expr2 or expr3 produce a floating-point value, the result is a
  floating-point value.

CHAR(N,... [USING charset_name])

CHAR() interprets each argument N as an integer and returns a string
consisting of the characters given by the code values of those
integers. NULL values are skipped.

By default, CHAR() returns a binary string. To produce a string in a
given character set, use the optional USING clause:

mysql> SELECT CHARSET(CHAR(X'65')), CHARSET(CHAR(X'65' USING utf8));
+----------------------+---------------------------------+

If USING is given and the result string is illegal for the given
character set, a warning is issued. Also, if strict SQL mode is
enabled, the result from CHAR() becomes NULL.

EXPORT_SET(bits,on,off[,separator[,number_of_bits]])

Returns a string such that for every bit set in the value bits, you get
an on string and for every bit not set in the value, you get an off
string. Bits in bits are examined from right to left (from low-order to
high-order bits). Strings are added to the result from left to right,
separated by the separator string (the default being the comma
character ,). The number of bits examined is given by number_of_bits,
which has a default of 64 if not specified. number_of_bits is silently
clipped to 64 if larger than 64. It is treated as an unsigned integer,
so a value of −1 is effectively the same as 64.

If all arguments to FIELD() are strings, all arguments are compared as
strings. If all arguments are numbers, they are compared as numbers.
Otherwise, the arguments are compared as double.

If str is NULL, the return value is 0 because NULL fails equality
comparison with any value. FIELD() is the complement of ELT().

string list strlist consisting of N substrings. A string list is a
string composed of substrings separated by , characters. If the first
argument is a constant string and the second is a column of type SET,
the FIND_IN_SET() function is optimized to use bit arithmetic. Returns
0 if str is not in strlist or if strlist is the empty string. Returns
NULL if either argument is NULL. This function does not work properly

LOAD_FILE(file_name)

Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string. To use this

the full path name to the file, and you must have the FILE privilege.
The file must be readable by the server and its size less than
max_allowed_packet bytes. If the secure_file_priv system variable is
set to a nonempty directory name, the file to be loaded must be located
in that directory. (Prior to MySQL 8.0.17, the file must be readable by
all, not just readable by the server.)

SOUNDEX(str)

Returns a soundex string from str. Two strings that sound almost the

are treated as vowels.

*Important*:

When using SOUNDEX(), you should be aware of the following limitations:

substring len characters long from string str, starting at position
pos. The forms that use FROM are standard SQL syntax. It is also
possible to use a negative value for pos. In this case, the beginning
of the substring is pos characters from the end of the string, rather

WEIGHT_STRING(str [AS {CHAR|BINARY}(N)] [flags])

This function returns the weight string for the input string. The
return value is a binary string that represents the comparison and
sorting value of the string. It has these properties:

o If WEIGHT_STRING(str1) = WEIGHT_STRING(str2), then str1 = str2 (str1
  and str2 are considered equal)

o If WEIGHT_STRING(str1) < WEIGHT_STRING(str2), then str1 < str2 (str1
  sorts before str2)

WEIGHT_STRING() is a debugging function intended for internal use. Its
behavior can change without notice between MySQL versions. It can be
used for testing and debugging of collations, especially if you are
adding a new collation. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/adding-collation.html.

This list briefly summarizes the arguments. More details are given in
the discussion following the list.

o str: The input string expression.

o AS clause: Optional; cast the input string to a given type and
  length.

o flags: Optional; unused.

The input string, str, is a string expression. If the input is a
nonbinary (character) string such as a CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT value,
the return value contains the collation weights for the string. If the
input is a binary (byte) string such as a BINARY, VARBINARY, or BLOB
value, the return value is the same as the input (the weight for each
byte in a binary string is the byte value). If the input is NULL,
WEIGHT_STRING() returns NULL.

Returns 1 if the string expr matches the regular expression specified
by the pattern pat, 0 otherwise. If expr or pat is NULL, the return
value is NULL.

The pattern can be an extended regular expression, the syntax for which
is discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/regexp.html#regexp-syntax. The
pattern need not be a literal string. For example, it can be specified
as a string expression or table column.

The optional match_type argument is a string that may contain any or
all the following characters specifying how to perform matching:

o c: Case sensitive matching.

o i: Case insensitive matching.

o m: Multiple-line mode. Recognize line terminators within the string.
  The default behavior is to match line terminators only at the start
  and end of the string expression.

o n: The . character matches line terminators. The default is for .
  matching to stop at the end of a line.

o u: Unix-only line endings. Only the newline character is recognized
  as a line ending by the ., ^, and $ match operators.

If characters specifying contradictory options are specified within
match_type, the rightmost one takes precedence.

By default, regular expression operations use the character set and
collation of the expr and pat arguments when deciding the type of a
character and performing the comparison. If the arguments have
different character sets or collations, coercibility rules apply as
described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-collation-coercibility.

*Note*:

Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for example, \n to
represent the newline character), you must double any \ that you use in
your expr and pat arguments.

UTF-16 character set; in MySQL 8.0.17 and later, the character set and
collation of the expression searched for matches is used. (Bug #94203,
Bug #29308212)

For additional information about how matching occurs, see the
description for REGEXP_LIKE().

164,RAND,13,"Syntax:
RAND([N])

Returns a random floating-point value v in the range 0 <= v < 1.0. To
obtain a random integer R in the range i <= R < j, use the expression
FLOOR(i + RAND() * (j − i)). For example, to obtain a random integer
in the range the range 7 <= R < 12, use the following statement:

SELECT FLOOR(7 + (RAND() * 5));

If an integer argument N is specified, it is used as the seed value:

o With a constant initializer argument, the seed is initialized once
  when the statement is prepared, prior to execution.

o With a nonconstant initializer argument (such as a column name), the
  seed is initialized with the value for each invocation of RAND().

One implication of this behavior is that for equal argument values,
RAND(N) returns the same value each time, and thus produces a
repeatable sequence of column values. In the following example, the
sequence of values produced by RAND(3) is the same both places it
occurs.

This is the inverse of the DATE_FORMAT() function. It takes a string
str and a format string format. STR_TO_DATE() returns a DATETIME value
if the format string contains both date and time parts, or a DATE or
TIME value if the string contains only date or time parts. If the date,
time, or datetime value extracted from str is illegal, STR_TO_DATE()
returns NULL and produces a warning.

The server scans str attempting to match format to it. The format
string can contain literal characters and format specifiers beginning
with %. Literal characters in format must match literally in str.
Format specifiers in format must match a date or time part in str. For
the specifiers that can be used in format, see the DATE_FORMAT()
function description.

mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('01,5,2013','%d,%m,%Y');
        -> '2013-05-01'
mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('May 1, 2013','%M %d,%Y');
        -> '2013-05-01'

Scanning starts at the beginning of str and fails if format is found
not to match. Extra characters at the end of str are ignored.

mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('a09:30:17','a%h:%i:%s');
        -> '09:30:17'
mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('a09:30:17','%h:%i:%s');
        -> NULL
mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('09:30:17a','%h:%i:%s');
        -> '09:30:17'

Unspecified date or time parts have a value of 0, so incompletely
specified values in str produce a result with some or all parts set to
0:

mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('abc','abc');
        -> '0000-00-00'
mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('9','%m');
        -> '0000-09-00'
mysql> SELECT STR_TO_DATE('9','%s');

210,SUBDATE,14,"Syntax:
SUBDATE(date,INTERVAL expr unit), SUBDATE(expr,days)

When invoked with the INTERVAL form of the second argument, SUBDATE()
is a synonym for DATE_SUB(). For information on the INTERVAL unit
argument, see the discussion for DATE_ADD().

mysql> SELECT DATE_SUB('2008-01-02', INTERVAL 31 DAY);
        -> '2007-12-02'
mysql> SELECT SUBDATE('2008-01-02', INTERVAL 31 DAY);
        -> '2007-12-02'

The second form enables the use of an integer value for days. In such
cases, it is interpreted as the number of days to be subtracted from
the date or datetime expression expr.

mysql> SELECT SUBDATE('2008-01-02 12:00:00', 31);
        -> '2007-12-02 12:00:00'

",https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html
212,SYSDATE,14,"Syntax:
SYSDATE([fsp])

Returns the current date and time as a value in 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'
or YYYYMMDDhhmmss format, depending on whether the function is used in
a string or numeric context.

If the fsp argument is given to specify a fractional seconds precision
from 0 to 6, the return value includes a fractional seconds part of
that many digits.

SYSDATE() returns the time at which it executes. This differs from the
behavior for NOW(), which returns a constant time that indicates the
time at which the statement began to execute. (Within a stored function
or trigger, NOW() returns the time at which the function or triggering
statement began to execute.)

mysql> SELECT NOW(), SLEEP(2), NOW();
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| NOW()               | SLEEP(2) | NOW()               |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+

mysql> SELECT SYSDATE(), SLEEP(2), SYSDATE();
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| SYSDATE()           | SLEEP(2) | SYSDATE()           |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| 2006-04-12 13:47:44 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:46 |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+

In addition, the SET TIMESTAMP statement affects the value returned by
NOW() but not by SYSDATE(). This means that timestamp settings in the
binary log have no effect on invocations of SYSDATE().

Because SYSDATE() can return different values even within the same
statement, and is not affected by SET TIMESTAMP, it is nondeterministic
and therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging
is used. If that is a problem, you can use row-based logging.

Alternatively, you can use the --sysdate-is-now option to cause
SYSDATE() to be an alias for NOW(). This works if the option is used on
both the master and the slave.

The nondeterministic nature of SYSDATE() also means that indexes cannot
be used for evaluating expressions that refer to it.

UNIX_TIMESTAMP([date])

If UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is called with no date argument, it returns a Unix
timestamp representing seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC.

If UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is called with a date argument, it returns the
value of the argument as seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC. The
server interprets date as a value in the session time zone and converts
it to an internal Unix timestamp value in UTC. (Clients can set the
session time zone as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html.) The
date argument may be a DATE, DATETIME, or TIMESTAMP string, or a number
in YYMMDD, YYMMDDhhmmss, YYYYMMDD, or YYYYMMDDhhmmss format. If the
argument includes a time part, it may optionally include a fractional
seconds part.

The return value is an integer if no argument is given or the argument
does not include a fractional seconds part, or DECIMAL if an argument
is given that includes a fractional seconds part.

When the date argument is a TIMESTAMP column, UNIX_TIMESTAMP() returns
the internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit
""string-to-Unix-timestamp"" conversion.

The valid range of argument values is the same as for the TIMESTAMP
data type: '1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000' UTC to '2038-01-19

231,MATCH AGAINST,12,"Syntax:
MATCH (col1,col2,...) AGAINST (expr [search_modifier])

MySQL has support for full-text indexing and searching:

o A full-text index in MySQL is an index of type FULLTEXT.

o Full-text indexes can be used only with InnoDB or MyISAM tables, and
  can be created only for CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT columns.

o MySQL provides a built-in full-text ngram parser that supports
  Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), and an installable MeCab
  full-text parser plugin for Japanese. Parsing differences are
  outlined in
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search-ngram.html,
  and
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search-mecab.html.

o A FULLTEXT index definition can be given in the CREATE TABLE
  statement when a table is created, or added later using ALTER TABLE
  or CREATE INDEX.

o For large data sets, it is much faster to load your data into a table
  that has no FULLTEXT index and then create the index after that, than
  to load data into a table that has an existing FULLTEXT index.

Full-text searching is performed using MATCH() ... AGAINST syntax.
MATCH() takes a comma-separated list that names the columns to be
searched. AGAINST takes a string to search for, and an optional
modifier that indicates what type of search to perform. The search
string must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation.
This rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for
each row.

There are three types of full-text searches:

o A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in
  natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special
  operators, with the exception of double quote ("") characters. The
  stopword list applies. For more information about stopword lists, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-stopwords.html.

  Full-text searches are natural language searches if the IN NATURAL
  LANGUAGE MODE modifier is given or if no modifier is given. For more
  information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-natural-language.htm
  l.

o A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a
  special query language. The string contains the words to search for.
  It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a
  word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be
  weighted higher or lower than usual. Certain common words (stopwords)
  are omitted from the search index and do not match if present in the
  search string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean
  search. For more information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-boolean.html.

o A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language
  search. The search string is used to perform a natural language
  search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search
  are added to the search string and the search is done again. The
  query returns the rows from the second search. The IN NATURAL
  LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION or WITH QUERY EXPANSION modifier
  specifies a query expansion search. For more information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-query-expansion.html

233,CAST,12,"Syntax:
CAST(expr AS type [ARRAY])

The CAST() function takes an expression of any type and produces a
result value of the specified type, similar to CONVERT(). For more
information, see the description of CONVERT().

In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, InnoDB allows the use of an additional ARRAY
keyword for creating a multi-valued index on a JSON array as part of
CREATE INDEX, CREATE TABLE, and ALTER TABLE statements. ARRAY is not
supported except when used to create a multi-valued index in one of
these statements, in which case it is required. The column being
indexed must be a column of type JSON. (CONVERT() does not support
multi-valued index creation or the ARRAY keyword.) The type following
the AS keyword may be any of the types supported by CAST(), with the
exception of BINARY and JSON, which are not supported for this purpose.
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-index-
multi-valued, provides syntax information and examples, as well as
other relevant information.

234,CONVERT,12,"Syntax:
CONVERT(expr,type), CONVERT(expr USING transcoding_name)

The CONVERT() function takes an expression of any type and produces a
result value of the specified type.

Discussion of CONVERT(expr, type) syntax here also applies to CAST(expr
AS type), which is equivalent.

CONVERT(... USING ...) is standard SQL syntax. The non-USING form of
CONVERT() is ODBC syntax.

CONVERT() with USING converts data between different character sets. In
MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the corresponding character
set names. For example, this statement converts the string 'abc' in the
default character set to the corresponding string in the utf8 character
set:

SELECT CONVERT('abc' USING utf8);

CONVERT() without USING and CAST() take an expression and a type value
specifying the result type. These type values are permitted:

o BINARY[(N)]

  Produces a string with the BINARY data type. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-varbinary.html for a
  description of how this affects comparisons. If the optional length N
  is given, BINARY(N) causes the cast to use no more than N bytes of
  the argument. Values shorter than N bytes are padded with 0x00 bytes
  to a length of N.

o CHAR[(N)] [charset_info]

  Produces a string with the CHAR data type. If the optional length N
  is given, CHAR(N) causes the cast to use no more than N characters of
  the argument. No padding occurs for values shorter than N characters.

  With no charset_info clause, CHAR produces a string with the default
  character set. To specify the character set explicitly, these
  charset_info values are permitted:

  o CHARACTER SET charset_name: Produces a string with the given
    character set.

  o ASCII: Shorthand for CHARACTER SET latin1.

  o UNICODE: Shorthand for CHARACTER SET ucs2.

  In all cases, the string has the default collation for the character
  set.

o DATE

  Produces a DATE value.

o DATETIME

  Produces a DATETIME value.

o DECIMAL[(M[,D])]

  Produces a DECIMAL value. If the optional M and D values are given,
  they specify the maximum number of digits (the precision) and the
  number of digits following the decimal point (the scale).

o DOUBLE

  Produces a DOUBLE result. Added in MySQL 8.0.17.

o FLOAT[(P)]

  If the precision P is not specified, produces a result of type FLOAT.
  If P is provided and 0 <= < P <= 24, the result is of type FLOAT. If
  25 <= P <= 53, the result is of type DOUBLE. If P < 0 or P > 53, an
  error is returned. Added in MySQL 8.0.17.

o JSON

  Produces a JSON value. For details on the rules for conversion of
  values between JSON and other types, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html#json-comparison.

o NCHAR[(N)]

  Like CHAR, but produces a string with the national character set. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-national.html.

  Unlike CHAR, NCHAR does not permit trailing character set information
  to be specified.

o REAL

  Produces a result of type REAL. This is actually FLOAT if
  REAL_AS_FLOAT SQL mode is enabled; otherwise the result is of type
  DOUBLE.

o SIGNED [INTEGER]

  Produces a signed integer value.

o TIME

  Produces a TIME value.

o UNSIGNED [INTEGER]

  Produces an unsigned integer value.

235,EXTRACTVALUE,12,"Syntax:
ExtractValue(xml_frag, xpath_expr)

ExtractValue() takes two string arguments, a fragment of XML markup
xml_frag and an XPath expression xpath_expr (also known as a locator);
it returns the text (CDATA) of the first text node which is a child of
the element or elements matched by the XPath expression.

Using this function is the equivalent of performing a match using the
xpath_expr after appending /text(). In other words,
ExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b') and
ExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b/text()') produce the same
result.

If multiple matches are found, the content of the first child text node
of each matching element is returned (in the order matched) as a
single, space-delimited string.

If no matching text node is found for the expression (including the
implicit /text())---for whatever reason, as long as xpath_expr is
valid, and xml_frag consists of elements which are properly nested and
closed---an empty string is returned. No distinction is made between a
match on an empty element and no match at all. This is by design.

If you need to determine whether no matching element was found in
xml_frag or such an element was found but contained no child text
nodes, you should test the result of an expression that uses the XPath
count() function. For example, both of these statements return an empty
string, as shown here:

mysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b');
+-------------------------------------+
| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b') |
+-------------------------------------+
|                                     |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b');
+-------------------------------------+
| ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b') |
+-------------------------------------+
|                                     |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

However, you can determine whether there was actually a matching
element using the following:

mysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)');
+-------------------------------------+
| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)') |
+-------------------------------------+
| 1                                   |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', 'count(/a/b)');
+-------------------------------------+
| ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', 'count(/a/b)') |

| 0                                   |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

might be contained within a matching tag, nor any of their content (see

245,AES_ENCRYPT,16,"Syntax:
AES_ENCRYPT(str,key_str[,init_vector])

AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() implement encryption and decryption of
data using the official AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm,
previously known as ""Rijndael."" The AES standard permits various key
lengths. By default these functions implement AES with a 128-bit key
length. Key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be used, as described later.
The key length is a trade off between performance and security.

AES_ENCRYPT() encrypts the string str using the key string key_str and
returns a binary string containing the encrypted output. AES_DECRYPT()
decrypts the encrypted string crypt_str using the key string key_str
and returns the original plaintext string. If either function argument
is NULL, the function returns NULL.

The str and crypt_str arguments can be any length, and padding is
automatically added to str so it is a multiple of a block as required
by block-based algorithms such as AES. This padding is automatically
removed by the AES_DECRYPT() function. The length of crypt_str can be
calculated using this formula:

16 * (trunc(string_length / 16) + 1)

For a key length of 128 bits, the most secure way to pass a key to the
key_str argument is to create a truly random 128-bit value and pass it
as a binary value. For example:

INSERT INTO t
VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text',UNHEX('F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3')));

A passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by hashing the
passphrase. For example:

INSERT INTO t
VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text', UNHEX(SHA2('My secret passphrase',512))));

Do not pass a password or passphrase directly to crypt_str, hash it
first. Previous versions of this documentation suggested the former
approach, but it is no longer recommended as the examples shown here
are more secure.

If AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it returns
NULL. However, it is possible for AES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL
value (possibly garbage) if the input data or the key is invalid.

AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() permit control of the block encryption
mode and take an optional init_vector initialization vector argument:

o The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode for
  block-based encryption algorithms. Its default value is aes-128-ecb,
  which signifies encryption using a key length of 128 bits and ECB
  mode. For a description of the permitted values of this variable, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html.

o The optional init_vector argument provides an initialization vector
  for block encryption modes that require it.

For modes that require the optional init_vector argument, it must be 16
bytes or longer (bytes in excess of 16 are ignored). An error occurs if
init_vector is missing.

For modes that do not require init_vector, it is ignored and a warning
is generated if it is specified.

A random string of bytes to use for the initialization vector can be
produced by calling RANDOM_BYTES(16). For encryption modes that require
an initialization vector, the same vector must be used for encryption
and decryption.

SHA2(str, hash_length)

Calculates the SHA-2 family of hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256,

result, which must have a value of 224, 256, 384, 512, or 0 (which is
equivalent to 256). If either argument is NULL or the hash length is
not one of the permitted values, the return value is NULL. Otherwise,
the function result is a hash value containing the desired number of

Given an SQL statement as a string, returns the statement digest hash

262,GET_LOCK,17,"Syntax:
GET_LOCK(str,timeout)

Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string str, using a
timeout of timeout seconds. A negative timeout value means infinite
timeout. The lock is exclusive. While held by one session, other
sessions cannot obtain a lock of the same name.

Returns 1 if the lock was obtained successfully, 0 if the attempt timed
out (for example, because another client has previously locked the
name), or NULL if an error occurred (such as running out of memory or
the thread was killed with mysqladmin kill).

A lock obtained with GET_LOCK() is released explicitly by executing
RELEASE_LOCK() or implicitly when your session terminates (either
normally or abnormally). Locks obtained with GET_LOCK() are not
released when transactions commit or roll back.

GET_LOCK() is implemented using the metadata locking (MDL) subsystem.
Multiple simultaneous locks can be acquired and GET_LOCK() does not
release any existing locks. For example, suppose that you execute these
statements:

SELECT GET_LOCK('lock1',10);
SELECT GET_LOCK('lock2',10);
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock2');
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock1');

The second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock and both RELEASE_LOCK()
calls return 1 (success).

It is even possible for a given session to acquire multiple locks for
the same name. Other sessions cannot acquire a lock with that name
until the acquiring session releases all its locks for the name.

Uniquely named locks acquired with GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance
Schema metadata_locks table. The OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL
LOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column indicates the lock name. In the case
that multiple locks are acquired for the same name, only the first lock
for the name registers a row in the metadata_locks table. Subsequent
locks for the name increment a counter in the lock but do not acquire
additional metadata locks. The metadata_locks row for the lock is
deleted when the last lock instance on the name is released.

The capability of acquiring multiple locks means there is the
possibility of deadlock among clients. When this happens, the server
chooses a caller and terminates its lock-acquisition request with an
ER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK error. This error does not cause transactions to
roll back.

MySQL enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64 characters.

GET_LOCK() can be used to implement application locks or to simulate
record locks. Names are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has
been locked within one session, GET_LOCK() blocks any request by
another session for a lock with the same name. This enables clients
that agree on a given lock name to use the name to perform cooperative
advisory locking. But be aware that it also enables a client that is
not among the set of cooperating clients to lock a name, either
inadvertently or deliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating
clients from locking that name. One way to reduce the likelihood of
this is to use lock names that are database-specific or
application-specific. For example, use lock names of the form
db_name.str or app_name.str.

FOUND_ROWS()

*Note*:

The SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS query modifier and accompanying FOUND_ROWS()
function are deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.17 and will be removed in a
future MySQL version. As a replacement, considering executing your
query with LIMIT, and then a second query with COUNT(*) and without
LIMIT to determine whether there are additional rows. For example,
instead of these queries:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tbl_name WHERE id > 100 LIMIT 10;
SELECT FOUND_ROWS();

Use these queries instead:

SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE id > 100 LIMIT 10;
SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE id > 100;

COUNT(*) is subject to certain optimizations. SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS
causes some optimizations to be disabled.

A SELECT statement may include a LIMIT clause to restrict the number of
rows the server returns to the client. In some cases, it is desirable
to know how many rows the statement would have returned without the
LIMIT, but without running the statement again. To obtain this row
count, include an SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS option in the SELECT statement,
and then invoke FOUND_ROWS() afterward:

277,LAST_INSERT_ID,18,"Syntax:
LAST_INSERT_ID(), LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)

With no argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns a BIGINT UNSIGNED (64-bit)
value representing the first automatically generated value successfully
inserted for an AUTO_INCREMENT column as a result of the most recently
executed INSERT statement. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() remains
unchanged if no rows are successfully inserted.

With an argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns an unsigned integer.

For example, after inserting a row that generates an AUTO_INCREMENT
value, you can get the value like this:

mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
        -> 195

The currently executing statement does not affect the value of
LAST_INSERT_ID(). Suppose that you generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value
with one statement, and then refer to LAST_INSERT_ID() in a
multiple-row INSERT statement that inserts rows into a table with its
own AUTO_INCREMENT column. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() will remain
stable in the second statement; its value for the second and later rows
is not affected by the earlier row insertions. (However, if you mix
references to LAST_INSERT_ID() and LAST_INSERT_ID(expr), the effect is
undefined.)

If the previous statement returned an error, the value of
LAST_INSERT_ID() is undefined. For transactional tables, if the
statement is rolled back due to an error, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()
is left undefined. For manual ROLLBACK, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()
is not restored to that before the transaction; it remains as it was at
the point of the ROLLBACK.

Within the body of a stored routine (procedure or function) or a
trigger, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID() changes the same way as for
statements executed outside the body of these kinds of objects. The
effect of a stored routine or trigger upon the value of
LAST_INSERT_ID() that is seen by following statements depends on the
kind of routine:

o If a stored procedure executes statements that change the value of
  LAST_INSERT_ID(), the changed value is seen by statements that follow
  the procedure call.

o For stored functions and triggers that change the value, the value is
  restored when the function or trigger ends, so following statements
  will not see a changed value.

279,ROW_COUNT,18,"Syntax:
ROW_COUNT()

ROW_COUNT() returns a value as follows:

o DDL statements: 0. This applies to statements such as CREATE TABLE or
  DROP TABLE.

o DML statements other than SELECT: The number of affected rows. This
  applies to statements such as UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE (as before),
  but now also to statements such as ALTER TABLE and LOAD DATA.

o SELECT: -1 if the statement returns a result set, or the number of
  rows ""affected"" if it does not. For example, for SELECT * FROM t1,
  ROW_COUNT() returns -1. For SELECT * FROM t1 INTO OUTFILE
  'file_name', ROW_COUNT() returns the number of rows written to the
  file.

o SIGNAL statements: 0.

For UPDATE statements, the affected-rows value by default is the number
of rows actually changed. If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag to
mysql_real_connect() when connecting to mysqld, the affected-rows value
is the number of rows ""found""; that is, matched by the WHERE clause.

For REPLACE statements, the affected-rows value is 2 if the new row
replaced an old row, because in this case, one row was inserted after
the duplicate was deleted.

For INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements, the affected-rows
value per row is 1 if the row is inserted as a new row, 2 if an
existing row is updated, and 0 if an existing row is set to its current
values. If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag, the affected-rows
value is 1 (not 0) if an existing row is set to its current values.

324,ST_LENGTH,25,"ST_Length(ls [, unit])

Returns a double-precision number indicating the length of the
LineString or MultiLineString value ls in its associated spatial
reference system. The length of a MultiLineString value is equal to the
sum of the lengths of its elements.

ST_Length() computes a result as follows:

o If the geometry is a valid LineString in a Cartesian SRS, the return
  value is the Cartesian length of the geometry.

o If the geometry is a valid MultiLineString in a Cartesian SRS, the
  return value is the sum of the Cartesian lengths of its elements.

o If the geometry is a valid LineString in a geographic SRS, the return
  value is the geodetic length of the geometry in that SRS, in meters.

o If the geometry is a valid MultiLineString in a geographic SRS, the
  return value is the sum of the geodetic lengths of its elements in
  that SRS, in meters.

ST_Length() handles its arguments as described in the introduction to
this section, with these exceptions:

o If the geometry is not a LineString or MultiLineString, the return
  value is NULL.

o If the geometry is geometrically invalid, either the result is an
  undefined length (that is, it can be any number), or an error occurs.

o If the length computation result is +inf, an ER_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE
  error occurs.

o If the geometry has a geographic SRS with a longitude or latitude
  that is out of range, an error occurs:

  o If any longitude argument is not in the range (−180, 180], an
    ER_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  o If any latitude argument is not in the range [−90, 90], an
    ER_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  Ranges shown are in degrees. The exact range limits deviate slightly
  due to floating-point arithmetic.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, ST_Length() permits an optional unit argument that
specifies the linear unit for the returned length value. These rules
apply:

o If a unit is specified but not supported by MySQL, an
  ER_UNIT_NOT_FOUND error occurs.

o If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is 0, an
  ER_GEOMETRY_IN_UNKNOWN_LENGTH_UNIT error occurs.

o If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is not 0, the
  result is in that unit.

o If a unit is not specified, the result is in the unit of the SRS of
  the geometries, whether Cartesian or geographic. Currently, all MySQL
  SRSs are expressed in meters.

A unit is supported if it is found in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
ST_UNITS_OF_MEASURE table. See

The first argument must be a string indicating a strategy option:

o For point strategies, permitted values are 'point_circle' and
  'point_square'.

o For join strategies, permitted values are 'join_round' and
  'join_miter'.

o For end strategies, permitted values are 'end_round' and 'end_flat'.

If the first argument is 'point_circle', 'join_round', 'join_miter', or
'end_round', the points_per_circle argument must be given as a positive
numeric value. The maximum points_per_circle value is the value of the
max_points_in_geometry system variable.

341,ST_TRANSFORM,27,"ST_Transform(g, target_srid)

Transforms a geometry from one spatial reference system (SRS) to
another. The return value is a geometry of the same type as the input
geometry with all coordinates transformed to the target SRID,
target_srid. Transformation support is limited to geographic SRSs,
unless the SRID of the geometry argument is the same as the target SRID
value, in which case the return value is the input geometry for any
valid SRS.

ST_Transform() handles its arguments as described in the introduction
to this section, with these exceptions:

o Geometry arguments that have an SRID value for a geographic SRS do
  not produce an error.

o If the geometry or target SRID argument has an SRID value that refers
  to an undefined spatial reference system (SRS), an ER_SRS_NOT_FOUND
  error occurs.

o If the geometry is in an SRS that ST_Transform() cannot transform
  from, an ER_TRANSFORM_SOURCE_SRS_NOT_SUPPORTED error occurs.

o If the target SRID is in an SRS that ST_Transform() cannot transform
  to, an ER_TRANSFORM_TARGET_SRS_NOT_SUPPORTED error occurs.

o If the geometry is in an SRS that is not WGS 84 and has no TOWGS84
  clause, an ER_TRANSFORM_SOURCE_SRS_MISSING_TOWGS84 error occurs.

o If the target SRID is in an SRS that is not WGS 84 and has no TOWGS84
  clause, an ER_TRANSFORM_TARGET_SRS_MISSING_TOWGS84 error occurs.

ST_SRID(g, target_srid) and ST_Transform(g, target_srid) differ as
follows:

o ST_SRID() changes the geometry SRID value without transforming its
  coordinates.

o ST_Transform() transforms the geometry coordinates in addition to
  changing its SRID value.

  does not cover the entire interior of g1.

Returns the distance between g1 and g2, measured in the length unit of
the spatial reference system (SRS) of the geometry arguments, or in the
unit of the optional unit argument if that is specified.

This function processes geometry collections by returning the shortest
distance among all combinations of the components of the two geometry
arguments.

ST_Distance() handles its geometry arguments as described in the
introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

o ST_Distance() detects arguments in a geographic (ellipsoidal) spatial
  reference system and returns the geodetic distance on the ellipsoid.
  As of MySQL 8.0.18, ST_Distance() supports distance calculations for
  geographic SRS arguments of all geometry types. Prior to MySQL
  8.0.18, the only permitted geographic argument types are Point and
  Point, or Point and MultiPoint (in any argument order). If called
  with other geometry type argument combinations in a geographic SRS,
  an ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS error occurs.

o If any argument is geometrically invalid, either the result is an
  undefined distance (that is, it can be any number), or an error
  occurs.

o If an intermediate or final result produces NaN or a negative number,
  an ER_GIS_INVALID_DATA error occurs.

As of MySQL 8.0.14, ST_Distance() permits an optional unit argument
that specifies the linear unit for the returned distance value. These
rules apply:

o If a unit is specified but not supported by MySQL, an
  ER_UNIT_NOT_FOUND error occurs.

o If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is 0, an
  ER_GEOMETRY_IN_UNKNOWN_LENGTH_UNIT error occurs.

o If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is not 0, the
  result is in that unit.

o If a unit is not specified, the result is in the unit of the SRS of
  the geometries, whether Cartesian or geographic. Currently, all MySQL
  SRSs are expressed in meters.

A unit is supported if it is found in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
ST_UNITS_OF_MEASURE table. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/st-units-of-measure-table.html.

interpreted as longitude and latitude, respectively, in degrees.

If both geometry parameters are valid Point or MultiPoint values in a
geographic spatial reference system (SRS), the return value is the
shortest distance between the two geometries on a sphere with the
provided radius. If omitted, the default radius is equal to the mean
radius, defined as (2a+b)/3, where a is the semi-major axis and b is
the semi-minor axis of the SRS.

ST_Distance_Sphere() handles its arguments as described in the
introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

o Supported geometry argument combinations are Point and Point, or
  Point and MultiPoint (in any argument order). If at least one of the
  geometries is neither Point nor MultiPoint, and its SRID is 0, an
  ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_CARTESIAN_SRS error occurs. If at least one of
  the geometries is neither Point nor MultiPoint, and its SRID refers
  to a geographic SRS, an ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS error
  occurs. If any geometry refers to a projected SRS, an
  ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_PROJECTED_SRS error occurs.

o If any argument has a longitude or latitude that is out of range, an
  error occurs:

  o If any longitude argument is not in the range (−180, 180], an
    ER_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  o If any latitude argument is not in the range [−90, 90], an
    ER_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  Ranges shown are in degrees. If an SRS uses another unit, the range
  uses the corresponding values in its unit. The exact range limits
  deviate slightly due to floating-point arithmetic.

o If the radius argument is present but not positive, an
  ER_NONPOSITIVE_RADIUS error occurs.

o If the distance exceeds the range of a double-precision number, an
  ER_STD_OVERFLOW_ERROR error occurs.

369,ST_MAKEENVELOPE,29,"ST_MakeEnvelope(pt1, pt2)

Returns the rectangle that forms the envelope around two points, as a
Point, LineString, or Polygon.

Calculations are done using the Cartesian coordinate system rather than
on a sphere, spheroid, or on earth.

Given two points pt1 and pt2, ST_MakeEnvelope() creates the result
geometry on an abstract plane like this:

o If pt1 and pt2 are equal, the result is the point pt1.

o Otherwise, if (pt1, pt2) is a vertical or horizontal line segment,
  the result is the line segment (pt1, pt2).

o Otherwise, the result is a polygon using pt1 and pt2 as diagonal
  points.

The result geometry has an SRID of 0.

ST_MakeEnvelope() handles its arguments as described in the
introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

o If the arguments are not Point values, an ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS error
  occurs.

o An ER_GIS_INVALID_DATA error occurs for the additional condition that

370,ST_SIMPLIFY,29,"ST_Simplify(g, max_distance)

Simplifies a geometry using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm and returns a
simplified value of the same type.

The geometry may be any geometry type, although the Douglas-Peucker
algorithm may not actually process every type. A geometry collection is
processed by giving its components one by one to the simplification
algorithm, and the returned geometries are put into a geometry
collection as result.

The max_distance argument is the distance (in units of the input
coordinates) of a vertex to other segments to be removed. Vertices
within this distance of the simplified linestring are removed.

According to Boost.Geometry, geometries might become invalid as a
result of the simplification process, and the process might create
self-intersections. To check the validity of the result, pass it to
ST_IsValid().

ST_Simplify() handles its arguments as described in the introduction to
this section, with this exception:

o If the max_distance argument is not positive, or is NaN, an
  ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS error occurs.

371,ST_VALIDATE,29,"ST_Validate(g)

Validates a geometry according to the OGC specification. A geometry can
be syntactically well-formed (WKB value plus SRID) but geometrically
invalid. For example, this polygon is geometrically invalid: POLYGON((0
0, 0 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0 0))

ST_Validate() returns the geometry if it is syntactically well-formed
and is geometrically valid, NULL if the argument is not syntactically
well-formed or is not geometrically valid or is NULL.

ST_Validate() can be used to filter out invalid geometry data, although
at a cost. For applications that require more precise results not
tainted by invalid data, this penalty may be worthwhile.

If the geometry argument is valid, it is returned as is, except that if
an input Polygon or MultiPolygon has clockwise rings, those rings are
reversed before checking for validity. If the geometry is valid, the
value with the reversed rings is returned.

The only valid empty geometry is represented in the form of an empty
geometry collection value. ST_Validate() returns it directly without
further checks in this case.

As of MySQL 8.0.13, ST_Validate() handles its arguments as described in
the introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

o If the geometry has a geographic SRS with a longitude or latitude
  that is out of range, an error occurs:

  o If any longitude argument is not in the range (−180, 180], an
    ER_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  o If any latitude argument is not in the range [−90, 90], an
    ER_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE error occurs.

  Ranges shown are in degrees. The exact range limits deviate slightly
  due to floating-point arithmetic.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, ST_Validate() handles its arguments as described
in the introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

o If the geometry is not syntactically well-formed, the return value is
  NULL. An ER_GIS_INVALID_DATA error does not occur.

o If the geometry has an SRID value for a geographic spatial reference
  system (SRS), an ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS error occurs.

JSON_CONTAINS(target, candidate[, path])

Indicates by returning 1 or 0 whether a given candidate JSON document
is contained within a target JSON document, or---if a path argument was
supplied---whether the candidate is found at a specific path within the
target. Returns NULL if any argument is NULL, or if the path argument
does not identify a section of the target document. An error occurs if
target or candidate is not a valid JSON document, or if the path
argument is not a valid path expression or contains a * or ** wildcard.

To check only whether any data exists at the path, use
JSON_CONTAINS_PATH() instead.

The following rules define containment:

o A candidate scalar is contained in a target scalar if and only if
  they are comparable and are equal. Two scalar values are comparable
  if they have the same JSON_TYPE() types, with the exception that
  values of types INTEGER and DECIMAL are also comparable to each
  other.

o A candidate array is contained in a target array if and only if every
  element in the candidate is contained in some element of the target.

o A candidate nonarray is contained in a target array if and only if
  the candidate is contained in some element of the target.

o A candidate object is contained in a target object if and only if for
  each key in the candidate there is a key with the same name in the
  target and the value associated with the candidate key is contained
  in the value associated with the target key.

Otherwise, the candidate value is not contained in the target document.

Starting with MySQL 8.0.17, queries using JSON_CONTAINS() on InnoDB
tables can be optimized using multi-valued indexes; see

JSON_OVERLAPS(json_doc1, json_doc2)

Compares two JSON documents. Returns true (1) if the two document have
any key-value pairs or array elements in common. If both arguments are
scalars, the function performs a simple equality test.

This function serves as counterpart to JSON_CONTAINS(), which requires
all elements of the array searched for to be present in the array
searched in. Thus, JSON_CONTAINS() performs an AND operation on search
keys, while JSON_OVERLAPS() performs an OR operation.

382,JSON_SEARCH,29,"Syntax:
JSON_SEARCH(json_doc, one_or_all, search_str[, escape_char[, path]
...])

Returns the path to the given string within a JSON document. Returns
NULL if any of the json_doc, search_str, or path arguments are NULL; no
path exists within the document; or search_str is not found. An error
occurs if the json_doc argument is not a valid JSON document, any path
argument is not a valid path expression, one_or_all is not 'one' or
'all', or escape_char is not a constant expression.

The one_or_all argument affects the search as follows:

o 'one': The search terminates after the first match and returns one
  path string. It is undefined which match is considered first.

o 'all': The search returns all matching path strings such that no
  duplicate paths are included. If there are multiple strings, they are
  autowrapped as an array. The order of the array elements is
  undefined.

Within the search_str search string argument, the % and _ characters
work as for the LIKE operator: % matches any number of characters
(including zero characters), and _ matches exactly one character.

To specify a literal % or _ character in the search string, precede it
by the escape character. The default is \ if the escape_char argument
is missing or NULL. Otherwise, escape_char must be a constant that is
empty or one character.

For more information about matching and escape character behavior, see
the description of LIKE in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-comparison-functions.htm
l. For escape character handling, a difference from the LIKE behavior
is that the escape character for JSON_SEARCH() must evaluate to a
constant at compile time, not just at execution time. For example, if
JSON_SEARCH() is used in a prepared statement and the escape_char
argument is supplied using a ? parameter, the parameter value might be
constant at execution time, but is not at compile time.

386,JSON_INSERT,29,"Syntax:
JSON_INSERT(json_doc, path, val[, path, val] ...)

Inserts data into a JSON document and returns the result. Returns NULL
if any argument is NULL. An error occurs if the json_doc argument is
not a valid JSON document or any path argument is not a valid path
expression or contains a * or ** wildcard.

The path-value pairs are evaluated left to right. The document produced
by evaluating one pair becomes the new value against which the next
pair is evaluated.

A path-value pair for an existing path in the document is ignored and
does not overwrite the existing document value. A path-value pair for a
nonexisting path in the document adds the value to the document if the
path identifies one of these types of values:

o A member not present in an existing object. The member is added to
  the object and associated with the new value.

o A position past the end of an existing array. The array is extended
  with the new value. If the existing value is not an array, it is
  autowrapped as an array, then extended with the new value.

Otherwise, a path-value pair for a nonexisting path in the document is
ignored and has no effect.

388,JSON_MERGE_PATCH(),29,"Syntax:
JSON_MERGE_PATCH(json_doc, json_doc[, json_doc] ...)

Performs an RFC 7396 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) compliant
merge of two or more JSON documents and returns the merged result,
without preserving members having duplicate keys. Raises an error if at
least one of the documents passed as arguments to this function is not
valid.

*Note*:

For an explanation and example of the differences between this function
and JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE(), see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.htm
l#json-merge-patch-json-merge-preserve-compared.

JSON_MERGE_PATCH() performs a merge as follows:

1. If the first argument is not an object, the result of the merge is
   the same as if an empty object had been merged with the second
   argument.

2. If the second argument is not an object, the result of the merge is
   the second argument.

3. If both arguments are objects, the result of the merge is an object
   with the following members:

  o All members of the first object which do not have a corresponding
    member with the same key in the second object.

  o All members of the second object which do not have a corresponding
    key in the first object, and whose value is not the JSON null
    literal.

  o All members with a key that exists in both the first and the second
    object, and whose value in the second object is not the JSON null
    literal. The values of these members are the results of recursively
    merging the value in the first object with the value in the second
    object.

398,JSON_TABLE,29,"Syntax:
JSON_TABLE(expr, path COLUMNS (column_list) [AS] alias)

Extracts data from a JSON document and returns it as a relational table
having the specified columns. The complete syntax for this function is
shown here:

JSON_TABLE(
    expr,
    path COLUMNS (column_list)
)   [AS] alias

column_list:
    column[, column][, ...]

column:
    name FOR ORDINALITY
    |  name type PATH string path [on_empty] [on_error]
    |  name type EXISTS PATH string path
    |  NESTED [PATH] path COLUMNS (column_list)

on_empty:
    {NULL | ERROR | DEFAULT json_string} ON EMPTY

on_error:
    {NULL | ERROR | DEFAULT json_string} ON ERROR

expr: This is an expression that returns JSON data. This can be a
constant ('{""a"":1}'), a column (t1.json_data, given table t1 specified
prior to JSON_TABLE() in the FROM clause), or a function call
(JSON_EXTRACT(t1,jsn_data,'$.post.comments')).

path: A JSON path expression, which is applied to the data source. We
refer to the JSON value matching the path as the row source; this is
used to generate a row of relational data. The COLUMNS clause evaluates
the row source, finds specific JSON values within the row source, and
returns those JSON values as SQL values in individual columns of a row
of relational data.

The alias is required. The usual rules for table aliases apply (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html).

400,JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_REPORT,29,"JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_REPORT(schema,document)

Validates a JSON document against a JSON schema. Both schema and
document are required. As with JSON_VALID_SCHEMA(), the schema must be
a valid JSON object, and the document must be a valid JSON document.
Provided that these conditions are met, the function returns a report,
as a JSON document, on the outcome of the validation. If the JSON
document is considered valid according to the JSON Schema, the function
returns a JSON object with one property valid having the value ""true"".
If the JSON document fails validation, the function returns a JSON
object which includes the properties listed here:

o valid: Always ""false"" for a failed schema validation

o reason: A human-readable string containing the reason for the failure

o schema-location: A JSON pointer URI fragment identifier indicating
  where in the JSON schema the validation failed (see Note following
  this list)

o document-location: A JSON pointer URI fragment identifier indicating
  where in the JSON document the validation failed (see Note following
  this list)

o schema-failed-keyword: A string containing the name of the keyword or
  property in the JSON schema that was violated

*Note*:

JSON pointer URI fragment identifiers are defined in RFC 6901 -
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#page-5). (These are not the same
as the JSON path notation used by JSON_EXTRACT() and other MySQL JSON
functions.) In this notation, # represents the entire document, and
#/myprop represents the portion of the document included in the
top-level property named myprop. See the specification just cited and
the examples shown later in this section for more information.

401,JSON_PRETTY,29,"JSON_PRETTY(json_val)

Provides pretty-printing of JSON values similar to that implemented in
PHP and by other languages and database systems. The value supplied
must be a JSON value or a valid string representation of a JSON value.
Extraneous whitespaces and newlines present in this value have no
effect on the output. For a NULL value, the function returns NULL. If
the value is not a JSON document, or if it cannot be parsed as one, the
function fails with an error.

Formatting of the output from this function adheres to the following
rules:

o Each array element or object member appears on a separate line,
  indented by one additional level as compared to its parent.

o Each level of indentation adds two leading spaces.

o A comma separating individual array elements or object members is
  printed before the newline that separates the two elements or
  members.

o The key and the value of an object member are separated by a colon
  followed by a space (': ').

o An empty object or array is printed on a single line. No space is
  printed between the opening and closing brace.

o Special characters in string scalars and key names are escaped
  employing the same rules used by the JSON_QUOTE() function.

For a JSON column value, this function shows how much storage space was
freed in its binary representation after it was updated in place using
JSON_SET(), JSON_REPLACE(), or JSON_REMOVE(). The argument can also be
a valid JSON document or a string which can be parsed as one---either
as a literal value or as the value of a user variable---in which case
the function returns 0. It returns a positive, nonzero value if the
argument is a JSON column value which has been updated as described
previously, such that its binary representation takes up less space
than it did prior to the update. For a JSON column which has been
updated such that its binary representation is the same as or larger
than before, or if the update was not able to take advantage of a
partial update, it returns 0; it returns NULL if the argument is NULL.

If json_val is not NULL, and neither is a valid JSON document nor can
be successfully parsed as one, an error results.

This function returns the number of bytes used to store the binary
representation of a JSON document. When the argument is a JSON column,
this is the space used to store the JSON document as it was inserted
into the column, prior to any partial updates that may have been
performed on it afterwards. json_val must be a valid JSON document or a

representation that is created by parsing the string as JSON and
converting it to binary. It returns NULL if the argument is NULL.

An error results when json_val is not NULL, and is not---or cannot be
successfully parsed as---a JSON document.

Wait until the server has applied all of the transactions whose global

If a timeout is specified, and timeout seconds elapse before all of the

  are threads for which instance memory is not available,
  PS_THREAD_ID() returns NULL; in this case,
  Performance_schema_thread_instances_lost will be nonzero.

479,ANY_VALUE,32,"ANY_VALUE(arg)

This function is useful for GROUP BY queries when the
ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode is enabled, for cases when MySQL rejects a
query that you know is valid for reasons that MySQL cannot determine.
The function return value and type are the same as the return value and
type of its argument, but the function result is not checked for the
ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode.

For example, if name is a nonindexed column, the following query fails
with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled:

mysql> SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP
BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.address' which
is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this
is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

The failure occurs because address is a nonaggregated column that is
neither named among GROUP BY columns nor functionally dependent on
them. As a result, the address value for rows within each name group is
nondeterministic. There are multiple ways to cause MySQL to accept the
query:

o Alter the table to make name a primary key or a unique NOT NULL
  column. This enables MySQL to determine that address is functionally
  dependent on name; that is, address is uniquely determined by name.
  (This technique is inapplicable if NULL must be permitted as a valid
  name value.)

o Use ANY_VALUE() to refer to address:

SELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;

  In this case, MySQL ignores the nondeterminism of address values
  within each name group and accepts the query. This may be useful if
  you simply do not care which value of a nonaggregated column is
  chosen for each group. ANY_VALUE() is not an aggregate function,
  unlike functions such as SUM() or COUNT(). It simply acts to suppress
  the test for nondeterminism.

o Disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY. This is equivalent to using ANY_VALUE()
  with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled, as described in the previous item.

ANY_VALUE() is also useful if functional dependence exists between
columns but MySQL cannot determine it. The following query is valid
because age is functionally dependent on the grouping column age-1, but
MySQL cannot tell that and rejects the query with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
enabled:

SELECT age FROM t GROUP BY age-1;

To cause MySQL to accept the query, use ANY_VALUE():

SELECT ANY_VALUE(age) FROM t GROUP BY age-1;

ANY_VALUE() can be used for queries that refer to aggregate functions
in the absence of a GROUP BY clause:

mysql> SELECT name, MAX(age) FROM t;
ERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression
#1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.name'; this
is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

Without GROUP BY, there is a single group and it is nondeterministic
which name value to choose for the group. ANY_VALUE() tells MySQL to
accept the query:

SELECT ANY_VALUE(name), MAX(age) FROM t;

It may be that, due to some property of a given data set, you know that
a selected nonaggregated column is effectively functionally dependent
on a GROUP BY column. For example, an application may enforce
uniqueness of one column with respect to another. In this case, using
ANY_VALUE() for the effectively functionally dependent column may make
sense.

480,BIN_TO_UUID,32,"BIN_TO_UUID(binary_uuid), BIN_TO_UUID(binary_uuid, swap_flag)

BIN_TO_UUID() is the inverse of UUID_TO_BIN(). It converts a binary
UUID to a string UUID and returns the result. The binary value should
be a UUID as a VARBINARY(16) value. The return value is a utf8 string
of five hexadecimal numbers separated by dashes. (For details about
this format, see the UUID() function description.) If the UUID argument
is NULL, the return value is NULL. If any argument is invalid, an error
occurs.

BIN_TO_UUID() takes one or two arguments:

o The one-argument form takes a binary UUID value. The UUID value is
  assumed not to have its time-low and time-high parts swapped. The
  string result is in the same order as the binary argument.

o The two-argument form takes a binary UUID value and a swap-flag
  value:

  o If swap_flag is 0, the two-argument form is equivalent to the
    one-argument form. The string result is in the same order as the
    binary argument.

  o If swap_flag is 1, the UUID value is assumed to have its time-low
    and time-high parts swapped. These parts are swapped back to their
    original position in the result value.

For usage examples and information about time-part swapping, see the
UUID_TO_BIN() function description.

482,GROUPING,32,"GROUPING(expr [, expr] ...)

For GROUP BY queries that include a WITH ROLLUP modifier, the ROLLUP
operation produces super-aggregate output rows where NULL represents
the set of all values. The GROUPING() function enables you to
distinguish NULL values for super-aggregate rows from NULL values in
regular grouped rows.

GROUPING() is permitted only in the select list or HAVING clause.

Each argument to GROUPING() must be an expression that exactly matches
an expression in the GROUP BY clause. The expression cannot be a
positional specifier. For each expression, GROUPING() produces 1 if the
expression value in the current row is a NULL representing a
super-aggregate value. Otherwise, GROUPING() produces 0, indicating
that the expression value is a NULL for a regular result row or is not
NULL.

Suppose that table t1 contains these rows, where NULL indicates
something like ""other"" or ""unknown"":

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+------+-------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity |
+------+-------+----------+
| ball | small |       10 |
| ball | large |       20 |
| ball | NULL  |        5 |
| hoop | small |       15 |
| hoop | large |        5 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |
+------+-------+----------+

A summary of the table without WITH ROLLUP looks like this:

mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size;
+------+-------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity |
+------+-------+----------+
| ball | small |       10 |
| ball | large |       20 |
| ball | NULL  |        5 |
| hoop | small |       15 |
| hoop | large |        5 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |
+------+-------+----------+

The result contains NULL values, but those do not represent
super-aggregate rows because the query does not include WITH ROLLUP.

Adding WITH ROLLUP produces super-aggregate summary rows containing
additional NULL values. However, without comparing this result to the
previous one, it is not easy to see which NULL values occur in
super-aggregate rows and which occur in regular grouped rows:

mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity |
+------+-------+----------+
| ball | NULL  |        5 |
| ball | large |       20 |
| ball | small |       10 |
| ball | NULL  |       35 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |
| hoop | large |        5 |
| hoop | small |       15 |
| hoop | NULL  |       23 |
| NULL | NULL  |       58 |
+------+-------+----------+

To distinguish NULL values in super-aggregate rows from those in
regular grouped rows, use GROUPING(), which returns 1 only for
super-aggregate NULL values:

mysql> SELECT
         name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity,
         GROUPING(name) AS grp_name,
         GROUPING(size) AS grp_size
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity | grp_name | grp_size |
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+
| ball | NULL  |        5 |        0 |        0 |
| ball | large |       20 |        0 |        0 |
| ball | small |       10 |        0 |        0 |
| ball | NULL  |       35 |        0 |        1 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |        0 |        0 |
| hoop | large |        5 |        0 |        0 |
| hoop | small |       15 |        0 |        0 |
| hoop | NULL  |       23 |        0 |        1 |
| NULL | NULL  |       58 |        1 |        1 |
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+

Common uses for GROUPING():

o Substitute a label for super-aggregate NULL values:

         IF(GROUPING(name) = 1, 'All items', name) AS name,
         IF(GROUPING(size) = 1, 'All sizes', size) AS size,
         SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;

o Return only super-aggregate lines by filtering out the regular
  grouped lines:

mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP
       HAVING GROUPING(name) = 1 OR GROUPING(size) = 1;
+------+------+----------+
| name | size | quantity |
+------+------+----------+
| ball | NULL |       35 |
| hoop | NULL |       23 |
| NULL | NULL |       58 |
+------+------+----------+

GROUPING() permits multiple expression arguments. In this case, the
GROUPING() return value represents a bitmask combined from the results
for each expression, where the lowest-order bit corresponds to the
result for the rightmost expression. For example, with three expression
arguments, GROUPING(expr1, expr2, expr3) is evaluated like this:

  result for GROUPING(expr3)
+ result for GROUPING(expr2) << 1
+ result for GROUPING(expr1) << 2

The following query shows how GROUPING() results for single arguments
combine for a multiple-argument call to produce a bitmask value:

mysql> SELECT
         name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity,
         GROUPING(name) AS grp_name,
         GROUPING(size) AS grp_size,
       GROUPING(name, size) AS grp_all
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
| name | size  | quantity | grp_name | grp_size | grp_all |
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
| ball | NULL  |        5 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| ball | large |       20 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| ball | small |       10 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| ball | NULL  |       35 |        0 |        1 |       1 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| hoop | large |        5 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| hoop | small |       15 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
| hoop | NULL  |       23 |        0 |        1 |       1 |
| NULL | NULL  |       58 |        1 |        1 |       3 |
+------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+

With multiple expression arguments, the GROUPING() return value is
nonzero if any expression represents a super-aggregate value.
Multiple-argument GROUPING() syntax thus provides a simpler way to
write the earlier query that returned only super-aggregate rows, by
using a single multiple-argument GROUPING() call rather than multiple
single-argument calls:

mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP
       HAVING GROUPING(name, size) <> 0;
+------+------+----------+
| name | size | quantity |
+------+------+----------+
| ball | NULL |       35 |
| hoop | NULL |       23 |
| NULL | NULL |       58 |
+------+------+----------+

Use of GROUPING() is subject to these limitations:

o Do not use subquery GROUP BY expressions as GROUPING() arguments
  because matching might fail. For example, matching fails for this
  query:

mysql> SELECT GROUPING((SELECT MAX(name) FROM t1))
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY (SELECT MAX(name) FROM t1) WITH ROLLUP;
ERROR 3580 (HY000): Argument #1 of GROUPING function is not in GROUP BY

o GROUP BY literal expressions should not be used within a HAVING
  clause as GROUPING() arguments. Due to differences between when the
  optimizer evaluates GROUP BY and HAVING, matching may succeed but
  GROUPING() evaluation does not produce the expected result. Consider
  this query:

SELECT a AS f1, 'w' AS f2
FROM t
GROUP BY f1, f2 WITH ROLLUP
HAVING GROUPING(f2) = 1;

  GROUPING() is evaluated earlier for the literal constant expression
  than for the HAVING clause as a whole and returns 0. To check whether
  a query such as this is affected, use EXPLAIN and look for Impossible
  having in the Extra column.

492,MASTER_POS_WAIT,32,"Syntax:
MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name,log_pos[,timeout][,channel])

This function is useful for control of master/slave synchronization. It
blocks until the slave has read and applied all updates up to the
specified position in the master log. The return value is the number of
log events the slave had to wait for to advance to the specified
position. The function returns NULL if the slave SQL thread is not
started, the slave's master information is not initialized, the
arguments are incorrect, or an error occurs. It returns -1 if the
timeout has been exceeded. If the slave SQL thread stops while
MASTER_POS_WAIT() is waiting, the function returns NULL. If the slave
is past the specified position, the function returns immediately.

On a multithreaded slave, the function waits until expiry of the limit
set by the slave_checkpoint_group or slave_checkpoint_period system
variable, when the checkpoint operation is called to update the status
of the slave. Depending on the setting for the system variables, the
function might therefore return some time after the specified position
was reached.

If a timeout value is specified, MASTER_POS_WAIT() stops waiting when
timeout seconds have elapsed. timeout must be greater than 0; a zero or
negative timeout means no timeout.

The optional channel value enables you to name which replication
channel the function applies to. See

SLEEP(duration)

Sleeps (pauses) for the number of seconds given by the duration
argument, then returns 0. The duration may have a fractional part. If
the argument is NULL or negative, SLEEP() produces a warning, or an

When sleep returns normally (without interruption), it returns 0:

mysql> SELECT SLEEP(1000);
+-------------+

495,UUID,32,"Syntax:
UUID()

Returns a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) generated according to RFC
4122, ""A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace""
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).

A UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in space and
time. Two calls to UUID() are expected to generate two different
values, even if these calls are performed on two separate devices not
connected to each other.

*Warning*:

Although UUID() values are intended to be unique, they are not
necessarily unguessable or unpredictable. If unpredictability is
required, UUID values should be generated some other way.

UUID() returns a value that conforms to UUID version 1 as described in
RFC 4122. The value is a 128-bit number represented as a utf8 string of
five hexadecimal numbers in aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
format:

o The first three numbers are generated from the low, middle, and high
  parts of a timestamp. The high part also includes the UUID version
  number.

o The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case the timestamp
  value loses monotonicity (for example, due to daylight saving time).

o The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides spatial
  uniqueness. A random number is substituted if the latter is not
  available (for example, because the host device has no Ethernet card,
  or it is unknown how to find the hardware address of an interface on
  the host operating system). In this case, spatial uniqueness cannot
  be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a collision should have very low
  probability.

  The MAC address of an interface is taken into account only on
  FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows. On other operating systems, MySQL uses a
  randomly generated 48-bit number.

496,UUID_SHORT,32,"Syntax:
UUID_SHORT()

Returns a ""short"" universal identifier as a 64-bit unsigned integer.
Values returned by UUID_SHORT() differ from the string-format 128-bit
identifiers returned by the UUID() function and have different
uniqueness properties. The value of UUID_SHORT() is guaranteed to be
unique if the following conditions hold:

o The server_id value of the current server is between 0 and 255 and is
  unique among your set of master and slave servers

o You do not set back the system time for your server host between
  mysqld restarts

o You invoke UUID_SHORT() on average fewer than 16 million times per

497,UUID_TO_BIN,32,"UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid), UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid, swap_flag)

Converts a string UUID to a binary UUID and returns the result. (The
IS_UUID() function description lists the permitted string UUID
formats.) The return binary UUID is a VARBINARY(16) value. If the UUID
argument is NULL, the return value is NULL. If any argument is invalid,
an error occurs.

UUID_TO_BIN() takes one or two arguments:

o The one-argument form takes a string UUID value. The binary result is
  in the same order as the string argument.

o The two-argument form takes a string UUID value and a flag value:

  o If swap_flag is 0, the two-argument form is equivalent to the
    one-argument form. The binary result is in the same order as the
    string argument.

  o If swap_flag is 1, the format of the return value differs: The
    time-low and time-high parts (the first and third groups of
    hexadecimal digits, respectively) are swapped. This moves the more
    rapidly varying part to the right and can improve indexing
    efficiency if the result is stored in an indexed column.

Time-part swapping assumes the use of UUID version 1 values, such as
are generated by the UUID() function. For UUID values produced by other
means that do not follow version 1 format, time-part swapping provides
no benefit. For details about version 1 format, see the UUID() function
description.

Suppose that you have the following string UUID value:

mysql> SET @uuid = '6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db';

To convert the string UUID to binary with or without time-part
swapping, use UUID_TO_BIN():

mysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid));
+----------------------------------+
| HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid))          |
+----------------------------------+
| 6CCD780CBABA102695645B8C656024DB |

+----------------------------------+
| 1026BABA6CCD780C95645B8C656024DB |
+----------------------------------+

To convert a binary UUID returned by UUID_TO_BIN() to a string UUID,
use BIN_TO_UUID(). If you produce a binary UUID by calling
UUID_TO_BIN() with a second argument of 1 to swap time parts, you
should also pass a second argument of 1 to BIN_TO_UUID() to unswap the
time parts when converting the binary UUID back to a string UUID:

mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid));
+--------------------------------------+
| BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid))      |
+--------------------------------------+
| 6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db |
+--------------------------------------+

mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,1),1);

+--------------------------------------+
| 6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db |
+--------------------------------------+

If the use of time-part swapping is not the same for the conversion in
both directions, the original UUID will not be recovered properly:

mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),1);
+--------------------------------------+
| BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),1)  |

VALUES(col_name) function in the UPDATE clause to refer to column
values from the INSERT portion of the statement. In other words,
VALUES(col_name) in the UPDATE clause refers to the value of col_name
that would be inserted, had no duplicate-key conflict occurred. This
function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts. The VALUES()
function is meaningful only in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of
INSERT statements and returns NULL otherwise. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html.

alter_specification:

ALTER DATABASE enables you to change the overall characteristics of a
database. These characteristics are stored in the data dictionary. To
use ALTER DATABASE, you need the ALTER privilege on the database. ALTER
SCHEMA is a synonym for ALTER DATABASE.

The database name can be omitted from the first syntax, in which case
the statement applies to the default database.

National Language Characteristics

The CHARACTER SET clause changes the default database character set.
The COLLATE clause changes the default database collation.
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html, discusses
character set and collation names.

You can see what character sets and collations are available using,
respectively, the SHOW CHARACTER SET and SHOW COLLATION statements. See
[HELP SHOW CHARACTER SET], and [HELP SHOW COLLATION], for more
information.

If you change the default character set or collation for a database,
stored routines that use the database defaults must be dropped and
recreated so that they use the new defaults. (In a stored routine,
variables with character data types use the database defaults if the
character set or collation are not specified explicitly. See [HELP
CREATE PROCEDURE].)

Encryption

The DEFAULT ENCRYPTION clause, introduced in MySQL 8.0.16, defines the
default database encryption, which is inherited by tables created in
the database. Changing the default encryption of the database does not
alter the encryption of existing tables associated with the schema.
Only newly-created tables inherit the default database encryption. An
ALTER DATABASE statement executed without a DEFAULT ENCRYPTION clause
retains the existing default database encryption. If the
table_encryption_privilege_check variable is enabled, the
TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN privilege is required to specify a default
encryption setting that differs from the default_table_encryption
setting. For more information, see

ALTER INSTANCE instance_action

instance_action: {
    ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY
  | ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY
  | RELOAD TLS [NO ROLLBACK ON ERROR]
}

ALTER INSTANCE defines actions applicable to a MySQL server instance.
The statement supports these actions:

o ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY

  This action rotates the master encryption key used for InnoDB
  tablespace encryption. Key rotation requires the ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN
  or SUPER privilege. To perform this action, a keyring plugin must be
  installed and configured. For instructions, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keyring.html.

  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY supports concurrent DML.
  However, it cannot be run concurrently with CREATE TABLE ...
  ENCRYPTION or ALTER TABLE ... ENCRYPTION operations, and locks are
  taken to prevent conflicts that could arise from concurrent execution
  of these statements. If one of the conflicting statements is running,
  it must complete before another can proceed.

  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY statements are written to the
  binary log so that they can be executed on replicated servers.

  For additional ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY usage
  information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-data-encryption.html.

o ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY

  This action rotates the binary log master key used for binary log
  encryption. Key rotation for the binary log master key requires the
  BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege. The statement cannot be
  used if the binlog_encryption system variable is set to OFF. To
  perform this action, a keyring plugin must be installed and
  configured. For instructions, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keyring.html.

  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY actions are not written to
  the binary log and are not executed on replication slaves. Binary log
  master key rotation can therefore be carried out in replication
  environments including a mix of MySQL versions. To schedule regular
  rotation of the binary log master key on all applicable master and
  slave servers, you can enable the MySQL Event Scheduler on each
  server and issue the ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY
  statement using a CREATE EVENT statement. If you rotate the binary
  log master key because you suspect that the current or any of the
  previous binary log master keys might have been compromised, issue
  the statement on every applicable master and slave server, which
  enables you to verify immediate compliance.

  For additional ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY usage
  information, including what to do if the process does not complete
  correctly or is interrupted by an unexpected server halt, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-binlog-encryption
  .html.

o ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS

  This action reconfigures the SSL context from the current values of
  the system variables that define the context. It also updates the
  status variables that reflect the active context values. This action
  requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN privilege.

  By default, the RELOAD TLS action rolls back with an error and has no
  effect if the configuration values do not permit creation of a new
  SSL context. The previous context values continue to be used for new
  connections.

  If the optional NO ROLLBACK ON ERROR clause is given and a new
  context cannot be created, rollback does not occur. Instead, a
  warning is generated and SSL is disabled for new connections.

  ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS statements are not written to the binary
  log (and thus are not replicated). SSL configuration is local and
  depends on local files not necessarily present on all servers
  involved.

  For additional information about reconfiguring the SSL context,
  including which system and status variables are context-related, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/using-encrypted-connections.h

ALTER LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    ADD UNDOFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]
    ENGINE [=] engine_name

This statement adds an UNDO file named 'file_name' to an existing log
file group logfile_group. An ALTER LOGFILE GROUP statement has one and
only one ADD UNDOFILE clause. No DROP UNDOFILE clause is currently
supported.

*Note*:

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means
that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each
Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a
tablespace and an undo log file with the same name, or an undo log file
and a data file with the same name.

The optional INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the UNDO file's initial size
in bytes; if not specified, the initial size defaults to 134217728 (128
MB). You may optionally follow size with a one-letter abbreviation for
an order of magnitude, similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this
is one of the letters M (megabytes) or G (gigabytes). (Bug #13116514,
Bug #16104705, Bug #62858)

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is
4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

The minimum allowed value for INITIAL_SIZE is 1048576 (1 MB). (Bug
#29574)

*Note*:

WAIT is parsed but otherwise ignored. This keyword currently has no
effect, and is intended for future expansion.

The ENGINE parameter (required) determines the storage engine which is
used by this log file group, with engine_name being the name of the
storage engine. Currently, the only accepted values for engine_name are
""NDBCLUSTER"" and ""NDB"". The two values are equivalent.

ALTER TABLE changes the structure of a table. For example, you can add
or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change the type of
existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself. You can also
change characteristics such as the storage engine used for the table or
the table comment.

o To use ALTER TABLE, you need ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT privileges for
  the table. Renaming a table requires ALTER and DROP on the old table,
  ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT on the new table.

o Following the table name, specify the alterations to be made. If none
  are given, ALTER TABLE does nothing.

o The syntax for many of the permissible alterations is similar to
  clauses of the CREATE TABLE statement. column_definition clauses use
  the same syntax for ADD and CHANGE as for CREATE TABLE. For more
  information, see [HELP CREATE TABLE].

o The word COLUMN is optional and can be omitted, except for RENAME
  COLUMN (to distinguish a column-renaming operation from the RENAME
  table-renaming operation).

o Multiple ADD, ALTER, DROP, and CHANGE clauses are permitted in a
  single ALTER TABLE statement, separated by commas. This is a MySQL
  extension to standard SQL, which permits only one of each clause per
  ALTER TABLE statement. For example, to drop multiple columns in a
  single statement, do this:

ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c, DROP COLUMN d;

o If a storage engine does not support an attempted ALTER TABLE
  operation, a warning may result. Such warnings can be displayed with
  SHOW WARNINGS. See [HELP SHOW WARNINGS]. For information on
  troubleshooting ALTER TABLE, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table-problems.html.

o For information about generated columns, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table-generated-columns
  .html.

o For usage examples, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table-examples.html.

o InnoDB in MySQL 8.0.17 and later supports addition of multi-valued
  indexes on JSON columns using a key_part specification can take the
  form (CAST json_path AS type ARRAY). See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-inde
  x-multi-valued, for detailed information regarding multi-valued index
  creation and usage of, as well as restrictions and limitations on
  multi-valued indexes.

o With the mysql_info() C API function, you can find out how many rows
  were copied by ALTER TABLE. See

ALTER [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name
  NDB only:  
    {ADD|DROP} DATAFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]
  InnoDB and NDB:

  InnoDB only:
    [SET {ACTIVE|INACTIVE}]
    [ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}]
  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]

This statement is used with NDB and InnoDB tablespaces. It can be used
to add a new data file to, or to drop a data file from an NDB
tablespace. It can also be used to rename an NDB Cluster Disk Data
tablespace, rename an InnoDB general tablespace, encrypt an InnoDB
general tablespace, or mark an InnoDB undo tablespace as active or
inactive.

The UNDO keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, is used with the SET
{ACTIVE|INACTIVE} clause to mark an InnoDB undo tablespace as active or
inactive. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html.

The ADD DATAFILE variant enables you to specify an initial size for an
NDB Disk Data tablespace using an INITIAL_SIZE clause, where size is
measured in bytes; the default value is 134217728 (128 MB). You may
optionally follow size with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of
magnitude, similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of
the letters M (megabytes) or G (gigabytes).

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is
4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

INITIAL_SIZE is rounded, explicitly, as for CREATE TABLESPACE.

Once a data file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however,
you can add more data files to an NDB tablespace using additional ALTER
TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE statements.

When ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a
data file is created on each Cluster data node, but only one row is
generated in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. See the description of
this table, as well as
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects
.html, for more information. ADD DATAFILE is not supported with InnoDB
tablespaces.

Using DROP DATAFILE with ALTER TABLESPACE drops the data file
'file_name' from an NDB tablespace. You cannot drop a data file from a
tablespace which is in use by any table; in other words, the data file
must be empty (no extents used). See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects
.html. In addition, any data file to be dropped must previously have
been added to the tablespace with CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER
TABLESPACE. DROP DATAFILE is not supported with InnoDB tablespaces.

WAIT is parsed but otherwise ignored. It is intended for future
expansion.

The ENGINE clause, which specifies the storage engine used by the
tablespace, is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The
tablespace storage engine is known by the data dictionary, making the
ENGINE clause obsolete. If the storage engine is specified, it must
match the tablespace storage engine defined in the data dictionary. The
only values for engine_name compatible with NDB tablespaces are NDB and
NDBCLUSTER.

RENAME TO operations are implicitly performed in autocommit mode,
regardless of the autocommit setting.

A RENAME TO operation cannot be performed while LOCK TABLES or FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK is in effect for tables that reside in the
tablespace.

Exclusive metadata locks are taken on tables that reside in a general
tablespace while the tablespace is renamed, which prevents concurrent
DDL. Concurrent DML is supported.

The CREATE TABLESPACE privilege is required to rename an InnoDB general
tablespace.

The ENCRYPTION clause enables or disables page-level data encryption
for an InnoDB general tablespace or the mysql system tablespace.
Encryption support for general tablespaces was introduced in MySQL
8.0.13. Encryption support for the mysql system tablespace was
introduced in MySQL 8.0.16.

A keyring plugin must be installed and configured before encryption can
be enabled.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the table_encryption_privilege_check variable is
enabled, the TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN privilege is required to alter a
general tablespace with an ENCRYPTION clause setting that differs from
the default_table_encryption setting.

Enabling encryption for a general tablespace fails if any table in the
tablespace belongs to a schema defined with DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='N'.
Similarly, disabling encryption fails if any table in the general
tablespace belongs to a schema defined with DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='Y'. The
DEFAULT ENCRYPTION schema option was introduced in MySQL 8.0.16.

If an ALTER TABLESPACE statement executed on a general tablespace does
not include an ENCRYPTION clause, the tablespace retains its current
encryption status, regardless of the default_table_encryption setting.

When a general tablespace or the mysql system tablespace is encrypted,
all tables residing in the tablespace are encrypted. Likewise, a table
created in an encrypted tablespace is encrypted.

The INPLACE algorithm is used when altering the ENCRYPTION attribute of
a general tablespace or the mysql system tablespace. The INPLACE
algorithm permits concurrent DML on tables that reside in the
tablespace. Concurrent DDL is blocked.

              WEEK | SECOND | YEAR_MONTH | DAY_HOUR | DAY_MINUTE |
              DAY_SECOND | HOUR_MINUTE | HOUR_SECOND | MINUTE_SECOND}

This statement creates and schedules a new event. The event will not
run unless the Event Scheduler is enabled. For information about
checking Event Scheduler status and enabling it if necessary, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/events-configuration.html.

CREATE EVENT requires the EVENT privilege for the schema in which the
event is to be created. If the DEFINER clause is present, the
privileges required depend on the user value, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects-security.html.

The minimum requirements for a valid CREATE EVENT statement are as
follows:

o The keywords CREATE EVENT plus an event name, which uniquely
  identifies the event in a database schema.

o An ON SCHEDULE clause, which determines when and how often the event
  executes.

o A DO clause, which contains the SQL statement to be executed by an
  event.

This is an example of a minimal CREATE EVENT statement:

CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;

The previous statement creates an event named myevent. This event
executes once---one hour following its creation---by running an SQL
statement that increments the value of the myschema.mytable table's
mycol column by 1.

The event_name must be a valid MySQL identifier with a maximum length
of 64 characters. Event names are not case-sensitive, so you cannot
have two events named myevent and MyEvent in the same schema. In
general, the rules governing event names are the same as those for
names of stored routines. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html.

An event is associated with a schema. If no schema is indicated as part
of event_name, the default (current) schema is assumed. To create an
event in a specific schema, qualify the event name with a schema using
schema_name.event_name syntax.

Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table
itself is created with CREATE TABLE. See [HELP CREATE TABLE]. This
guideline is especially important for InnoDB tables, where the primary
key determines the physical layout of rows in the data file. CREATE
INDEX enables you to add indexes to existing tables.

CREATE INDEX is mapped to an ALTER TABLE statement to create indexes.
See [HELP ALTER TABLE]. CREATE INDEX cannot be used to create a PRIMARY
KEY; use ALTER TABLE instead. For more information about indexes, see

    [NODEGROUP [=] nodegroup_id]
    [WAIT]
    [COMMENT [=] 'string']
    ENGINE [=] engine_name

This statement creates a new log file group named logfile_group having
a single UNDO file named 'undo_file'. A CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement
has one and only one ADD UNDOFILE clause. For rules covering the naming
of log file groups, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html.

*Note*:

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means
that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each
Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a
tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and
a data file with the same name.

There can be only one log file group per NDB Cluster instance at any
given time.

The optional INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the UNDO file's initial size;
if not specified, it defaults to 128M (128 megabytes). The optional
UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE parameter sets the size used by the UNDO buffer for
the log file group; The default value for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE is 8M (eight
megabytes); this value cannot exceed the amount of system memory
available. Both of these parameters are specified in bytes. You may
optionally follow either or both of these with a one-letter
abbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those used in
my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters M (for megabytes) or G
(for gigabytes).

Memory used for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE comes from the global pool whose size
is determined by the value of the SharedGlobalMemory data node
configuration parameter. This includes any default value implied for
this option by the setting of the InitialLogFileGroup data node
configuration parameter.

The maximum permitted for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE is 629145600 (600 MB).

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is
4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

The minimum allowed value for INITIAL_SIZE is 1048576 (1 MB).

The ENGINE option determines the storage engine to be used by this log
file group, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine. In
MySQL 8.0, this must be NDB (or NDBCLUSTER). If ENGINE is not set,
MySQL tries to use the engine specified by the default_storage_engine
server system variable (formerly storage_engine
(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#s
ysvar_storage_engine)). In any case, if the engine is not specified as
NDB or NDBCLUSTER, the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement appears to
succeed but actually fails to create the log file group, as shown here:

mysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1
    ->     ADD UNDOFILE 'undo.dat' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M;

    ->     ADD UNDOFILE 'undo.dat' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M
    ->     ENGINE = NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.97 sec)

The fact that the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement does not actually
return an error when a non-NDB storage engine is named, but rather
appears to succeed, is a known issue which we hope to address in a
future release of NDB Cluster.

REDO_BUFFER_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but ignored,
and so have no effect in MySQL 8.0. These options are intended for
future expansion.

When used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a log file group and associated UNDO log
file are created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the
UNDO files were created and obtain information about them by querying
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. For example:

mysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER, EXTRA
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
    -> WHERE FILE_NAME = 'undo_10.dat';
+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+
| LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER | EXTRA          |

+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.06 sec)

Cluster. See

    Valid SQL routine statement

These statements create stored routines. By default, a routine is
associated with the default database. To associate the routine
explicitly with a given database, specify the name as db_name.sp_name
when you create it.

The CREATE FUNCTION statement is also used in MySQL to support UDFs
(user-defined functions). See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/adding-functions.html. A UDF
can be regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions share
their namespace with UDFs. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/function-resolution.html, for
the rules describing how the server interprets references to different
kinds of functions.

To invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).
To invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function
returns a value during expression evaluation.

CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE
privilege. If the DEFINER clause is present, the privileges required
depend on the user value, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects-security.html.
If binary logging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER
privilege, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-programs-logging.html.

By default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE
privileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by
disabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines-privileges.html
.

The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be
used when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as
described later in this section.

If the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,
a syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the
following parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.
For this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for
your own stored routines.

The IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored
routines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored
routine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.

The parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.
If there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be
used. Parameter names are not case sensitive.

Each parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for
a parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.

*Note*:

Specifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a
PROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN
parameters.

An IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might
modify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller
when the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the
procedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the
procedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure
returns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be
modified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is
visible to the caller when the procedure returns.

For each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the
CALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its
value when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from
within another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a
routine parameter or local routine variable as an OUT or INOUT
parameter. If you are calling the procedure from within a trigger, you
can also pass NEW.col_name as an OUT or INOUT parameter.

For information about the effect of unhandled conditions on procedure
parameters, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/conditions-and-parameters.html.

Routine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared within
the routine; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-program-restrictions.htm
l.

The following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT
parameter:

mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)
    -> BEGIN
    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;
    -> END//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

mysql> CALL simpleproc(@a);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @a;
+------+
| @a   |
+------+
| 3    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

The example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the
statement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.
This enables the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed
through to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.
See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-programs-defining.html.

The RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it
is mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the
function body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN
statement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to
the proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET
value in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an
integer, the value returned from the function is the string for the
corresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.

The following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation
using an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is
unnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains
no internal ; statement delimiters:

mysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))
mysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
    -> RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT hello('world');
+----------------+
| hello('world') |
+----------------+
| Hello, world!  |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Parameter types and function return types can be declared to use any
valid data type. The COLLATE attribute can be used if preceded by a
CHARACTER SET specification.

The routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be
a simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement
written using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain
declarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax
for these statements is described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-compound-statements.html.
In practice, stored functions tend to use compound statements, unless
the body consists of a single RETURN statement.

MySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and
DROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)
to contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions
may not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or
rollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL
standard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to
permit them.

Statements that return a result set can be used within a stored
procedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes
SELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other
statements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that
can be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a
Not allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs
(ER_SP_NO_RETSET). For statements that can be determined only at
runtime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can't return a result
set in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT).

USE statements within stored routines are not permitted. When a routine
is invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the
routine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default
database while it executes. References to objects in databases other
than the routine default database should be qualified with the
appropriate database name.

For additional information about statements that are not permitted in
stored routines, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-program-restrictions.htm
l.

For information about invoking stored procedures from within programs
written in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].

MySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting in effect when a
routine is created or altered, and always executes the routine with
this setting in force, regardless of the current server SQL mode when
the routine begins executing.

The switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine
occurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting
values to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL
mode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to
routine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require
that expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,
you should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.

routine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default
database while it executes. References to objects in databases other
than the routine default database should be qualified with the
appropriate database name.

l.

For information about invoking stored procedures from within programs
written in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].

MySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting in effect when a
routine is created or altered, and always executes the routine with
this setting in force, regardless of the current server SQL mode when
the routine begins executing.

The switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine
occurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting
values to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL
mode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to
routine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require
that expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,
you should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.

  | PORT numeric-literal }

This statement creates the definition of a server for use with the
FEDERATED storage engine. The CREATE SERVER statement creates a new row
in the servers table in the mysql database. This statement requires the
SUPER privilege.

The server_name should be a unique reference to the server. Server
definitions are global within the scope of the server, it is not
possible to qualify the server definition to a specific database.
server_name has a maximum length of 64 characters (names longer than 64
characters are silently truncated), and is case insensitive. You may
specify the name as a quoted string.

The wrapper_name is an identifier and may be quoted with single
quotation marks.

For each option you must specify either a character literal or numeric
literal. Character literals are UTF-8, support a maximum length of 64
characters and default to a blank (empty) string. String literals are
silently truncated to 64 characters. Numeric literals must be a number
between 0 and 9999, default value is 0.

*Note*:

The OWNER option is currently not applied, and has no effect on the
ownership or operation of the server connection that is created.

The CREATE SERVER statement creates an entry in the mysql.servers table
that can later be used with the CREATE TABLE statement when creating a
FEDERATED table. The options that you specify will be used to populate
the columns in the mysql.servers table. The table columns are
Server_name, Host, Db, Username, Password, Port and Socket.

the INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS table. This
statement requires the SUPER privilege.

If neither OR REPLACE nor IF NOT EXISTS is specified, an error occurs
if an SRS definition with the SRID value already exists.

With CREATE OR REPLACE syntax, any existing SRS definition with the
same SRID value is replaced, unless the SRID value is used by some
column in an existing table. In that case, an error occurs. For
example:

ERROR 3716 (SR005): Can't modify SRID 4326. There is at
least one column depending on it.

To identify which column or columns use the SRID, use this query:

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS WHERE SRS_ID=4326;

With CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS syntax, any existing SRS definition with
the same SRID value causes the new definition to be ignored and a

CREATE TABLE creates a table with the given name. You must have the
CREATE privilege for the table.

By default, tables are created in the default database, using the
InnoDB storage engine. An error occurs if the table exists, if there is
no default database, or if the database does not exist.

MySQL has no limit on the number of tables. The underlying file system
may have a limit on the number of files that represent tables.
Individual storage engines may impose engine-specific constraints.
InnoDB permits up to 4 billion tables.

Considerations for InnoDB

CREATE TABLESPACE syntax is used to create general tablespaces or undo
tablespaces. The UNDO keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, must be
specified to create an undo tablespace.

A general tablespace is a shared tablespace. It can hold multiple
tables, and supports all table row formats. General tablespaces can be
created in a location relative to or independent of the data directory.

After creating an InnoDB general tablespace, use CREATE TABLE tbl_name
... TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name or ALTER TABLE tbl_name TABLESPACE
[=] tablespace_name to add tables to the tablespace. For more
information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/general-tablespaces.html.

Undo tablespaces contain undo logs. Undo tablespaces can be created in
a chosen location by specifying a fully qualified data file path. For
more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html.

Considerations for NDB Cluster

This statement is used to create a tablespace, which can contain one or
more data files, providing storage space for NDB Cluster Disk Data
tables (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html).
One data file is created and added to the tablespace using this
statement. Additional data files may be added to the tablespace by
using the ALTER TABLESPACE statement (see [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE]).

*Note*:

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means
that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each
Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a
tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and
a data file with the same name.

A log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the
tablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.
logfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE
LOGFILE GROUP (see [HELP CREATE LOGFILE GROUP]). Multiple tablespaces
may use the same log file group for UNDO logging.

When setting EXTENT_SIZE or INITIAL_SIZE, you may optionally follow the
number with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude,
similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters
M (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).

INITIAL_SIZE and EXTENT_SIZE are subject to rounding as follows:

o EXTENT_SIZE is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.

o INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K;
  this result is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of
  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).

The rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued
by the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded
values are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other purposes. However, to
avoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole
multiples of 32K in specifying these options.

When CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a tablespace and
associated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can
verify that the data files were created and obtain information about
them by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. (See the example
later in this section.)

(See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/files-table.html.)

Options

o ADD DATAFILE: Defines the name of a tablespace data file. The ADD
  DATAFILE clause is required when creating undo tablespaces.
  Otherwise, it is optional as of MySQL 8.0.14.

  An InnoDB tablespace supports only a single data file, whose name
  must include a .ibd extension. An NDB Cluster tablespace supports
  multiple data files which can have any legal file names; more data
  files can be added to an NDB Cluster tablespace following its
  creation by using an ALTER TABLESPACE statement.

  To place a general tablespace data file in a location outside of the
  data directory, include a fully qualified path or a path relative to
  the data directory. Only a fully qualified path is permitted for undo
  tablespaces. If you do not specify a path, a general tablespace is
  created in the data directory. An undo tablespace created without
  specifying a path is created in the directory defined by the
  innodb_undo_directory variable. If the innodb_undo_directory variable
  is undefined, undo tablespaces are created in the data directory.

  Creating a general tablespace in a subdirectory under the data
  directory is not supported to avoid conflicts with implicitly created
  file-per-table tablespaces. When creating a general tablespace or
  undo tablespace outside of the data directory, the directory must
  exist and must be known to InnoDB prior to creating the tablespace.
  To make a directory known to InnoDB, add it to the innodb_directories
  value or to one of the variables whose values are appended to the
  innodb_directories value. innodb_directories is a read-only variable.
  Configuring it requires restarting the server.

  The file_name, including any specified path, must be quoted with
  single or double quotations marks. File names (not counting the file
  extension) and directory names must be at least one byte in length.
  Zero length file names and directory names are not supported.

  If the ADD DATAFILE clause is not specified when creating a
  tablespace, a tablespace data file with a unique file name is created
  implicitly. The unique file name is a 128 bit UUID formatted into
  five groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by dashes
  (aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee). A file extension is added if
  required by the storage engine. An .ibd file extension is added for
  InnoDB general tablespace data files. In a replication environment,
  the data file name created on the master is not the same as the data
  file name created on the slave.

  As of MySQL 8.0.17, the ADD DATAFILE clause does not permit circular
  directory references when creating an InnoDB tablespace. For example,
  the circular directory reference (/../) in the following statement is
  not permitted:

CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ADD DATAFILE ts1.ibd 'any_directory/../ts1.ibd';

  An exception to this restriction exists on Linux, where a circular
  directory reference is permitted if the preceding directory is a
  symbolic link. For example, the data file path in the example above
  is permitted if any_directory is a symbolic link. (It is still
  permitted for data file paths to begin with '../'.)

o FILE_BLOCK_SIZE: This option---which is specific to InnoDB general
  tablespaces, and is ignored by NDB---defines the block size for the
  tablespace data file. Values can be specified in bytes or kilobytes.
  For example, an 8 kilobyte file block size can be specified as 8192
  or 8K. If you do not specify this option, FILE_BLOCK_SIZE defaults to
  the innodb_page_size value. FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is required when you
  intend to use the tablespace for storing compressed InnoDB tables
  (ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED). In this case, you must define the tablespace
  FILE_BLOCK_SIZE when creating the tablespace.

  If FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is equal the innodb_page_size value, the
  tablespace can contain only tables having an uncompressed row format
  (COMPACT, REDUNDANT, and DYNAMIC). Tables with a COMPRESSED row
  format have a different physical page size than uncompressed tables.
  Therefore, compressed tables cannot coexist in the same tablespace as
  uncompressed tables.

  For a general tablespace to contain compressed tables,
  FILE_BLOCK_SIZE must be specified, and the FILE_BLOCK_SIZE value must
  be a valid compressed page size in relation to the innodb_page_size
  value. Also, the physical page size of the compressed table
  (KEY_BLOCK_SIZE) must be equal to FILE_BLOCK_SIZE/1024. For example,
  if innodb_page_size=16K, and FILE_BLOCK_SIZE=8K, the KEY_BLOCK_SIZE
  of the table must be 8. For more information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/general-tablespaces.html.

o USE LOGFILE GROUP: Required for NDB, this is the name of a log file
  group previously created using CREATE LOGFILE GROUP. Not supported
  for InnoDB, where it fails with an error.

o EXTENT_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by
  InnoDB, where it fails with an error. EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in
  bytes, of the extents used by any files belonging to the tablespace.
  The default value is 1M. The minimum size is 32K, and theoretical
  maximum is 2G, although the practical maximum size depends on a
  number of factors. In most cases, changing the extent size does not
  have any measurable effect on performance, and the default value is
  recommended for all but the most unusual situations.

  An extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled
  with as much data as that extent can contain before another extent is
  used. In theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file;
  however, the recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended
  maximum size for a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1
  MB per extent. In addition, once an extent is allocated to a given
  partition, it cannot be used to store data from a different
  partition; an extent cannot store data from more than one partition.
  This means, for example that a tablespace having a single datafile
  whose INITIAL_SIZE (described in the following item) is 256 MB and
  whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used to
  store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.

  You can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by
  querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an
  estimate for how much space remains free in the file. For further
  discussion and examples, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/files-table.html.

o INITIAL_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by
  InnoDB, where it fails with an error.

  The INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the total size in bytes of the data
  file that was specific using ADD DATATFILE. Once this file has been
  created, its size cannot be changed; however, you can add more data
  files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE.

  INITIAL_SIZE is optional; its default value is 134217728 (128 MB).

  On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is
  4294967296 (4 GB).

o AUTOEXTEND_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible
  future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB
  Cluster 8.0, regardless of the storage engine used.

o MAX_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future
  use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster
  8.0, regardless of the storage engine used.

o NODEGROUP: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future
  use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster
  8.0, regardless of the storage engine used.

o WAIT: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future use.
  Has no effect in any release of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0,
  regardless of the storage engine used.

o COMMENT: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future
  use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster
  8.0, regardless of the storage engine used.

o The ENCRYPTION clause enables or disables page-level data encryption
  for an InnoDB general tablespace. Encryption support for general
  tablespaces was introduced in MySQL 8.0.13.

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the ENCRYPTION clause is not specified, the
  default_table_encryption setting controls whether encryption is
  enabled. The ENCRYPTION clause overrides the default_table_encryption
  setting. However, if the table_encryption_privilege_check variable is
  enabled, the TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN privilege is required to use an
  ENCRYPTION clause setting that differs from the
  default_table_encryption setting.

  A keyring plugin must be installed and configured before an
  encryption-enabled tablespace can be created.

  When a general tablespace is encrypted, all tables residing in the
  tablespace are encrypted. Likewise, a table created in an encrypted
  tablespace is encrypted.

  For more information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-data-encryption.html

o ENGINE: Defines the storage engine which uses the tablespace, where
  engine_name is the name of the storage engine. Currently, only the
  InnoDB storage engine is supported by standard MySQL 8.0 releases.
  MySQL NDB Cluster supports both NDB and InnoDB tablespaces. The value
  of the default_storage_engine system variable is used for ENGINE if
  the option is not specified.

Notes

o For the rules covering the naming of MySQL tablespaces, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html. In addition
  to these rules, the slash character (""/"") is not permitted, nor can
  you use names beginning with innodb_, as this prefix is reserved for
  system use.

o Creation of temporary general tablespaces is not supported.

o General tablespaces do not support temporary tables.

o The TABLESPACE option may be used with CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE to
  assign an InnoDB table partition or subpartition to a file-per-table
  tablespace. All partitions must belong to the same storage engine.
  Assigning table partitions to shared InnoDB tablespaces is not
  supported. Shared tablespaces include the InnoDB system tablespace
  and general tablespaces.

o General tablespaces support the addition of tables of any row format
  using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE. innodb_file_per_table does not
  need to be enabled.

o innodb_strict_mode is not applicable to general tablespaces.
  Tablespace management rules are strictly enforced independently of
  innodb_strict_mode. If CREATE TABLESPACE parameters are incorrect or
  incompatible, the operation fails regardless of the
  innodb_strict_mode setting. When a table is added to a general
  tablespace using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLE ...
  TABLESPACE, innodb_strict_mode is ignored but the statement is
  evaluated as if innodb_strict_mode is enabled.

o Use DROP TABLESPACE to remove a tablespace. All tables must be
  dropped from a tablespace using DROP TABLE prior to dropping the
  tablespace. Before dropping an NDB Cluster tablespace you must also
  remove all its data files using one or more ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP
  DATATFILE statements. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objec
  ts.html.

o All parts of an InnoDB table added to an InnoDB general tablespace
  reside in the general tablespace, including indexes and BLOB pages.

  For an NDB table assigned to a tablespace, only those columns which
  are not indexed are stored on disk, and actually use the tablespace
  data files. Indexes and indexed columns for all NDB tables are always
  kept in memory.

o Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables
  stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the
  general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new
  InnoDB data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it
  is for file-per-table tablespaces.

o A general tablespace is not associated with any database or schema.

o ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD TABLESPACE and ALTER TABLE ...IMPORT
  TABLESPACE are not supported for tables that belong to a general
  tablespace.

o The server uses tablespace-level metadata locking for DDL that
  references general tablespaces. By comparison, the server uses
  table-level metadata locking for DDL that references file-per-table
  tablespaces.

o A generated or existing tablespace cannot be changed to a general
  tablespace.

o There is no conflict between general tablespace names and
  file-per-table tablespace names. The ""/"" character, which is present
  in file-per-table tablespace names, is not permitted in general
  tablespace names.

o mysqldump and mysqlpump do not dump InnoDB CREATE TABLESPACE
  statements.

InnoDB Examples

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding
three uncompressed tables of different row formats.

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' ENGINE=INNODB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding a
compressed table. The example assumes a default innodb_page_size value
of 16K. The FILE_BLOCK_SIZE of 8192 requires that the compressed table
have a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8.

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts2` ADD DATAFILE 'ts2.ibd' FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = 8192 Engine=InnoDB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts2 ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace without
specifying the ADD DATAFILE clause, which is optional as of MySQL
8.0.14.

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts3` ENGINE=INNODB;

This example demonstrates creating an undo tablespace.

mysql> CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE undo_003 ADD DATAFILE 'undo_003.ibu';

NDB Example

Suppose that you wish to create an NDB Cluster Disk Data tablespace
named myts using a datafile named mydata-1.dat. An NDB tablespace
always requires the use of a log file group consisting of one or more
undo log files. For this example, we first create a log file group
named mylg that contains one undo long file named myundo-1.dat, using
the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement shown here:

mysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP myg1
    ->     ADD UNDOFILE 'myundo-1.dat'
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.29 sec)

Now you can create the tablespace previously described using the
following statement:

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts
    ->     ADD DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.98 sec)

You can now create a Disk Data table using a CREATE TABLE statement
with the TABLESPACE and STORAGE DISK options, similar to what is shown
here:

mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ->     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     dob DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     joined DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     INDEX(last_name, first_name)
    -> )
    ->     TABLESPACE myts STORAGE DISK
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.41 sec)

It is important to note that only the dob and joined columns from
mytable are actually stored on disk, due to the fact that the id,
lname, and fname columns are all indexed.

As mentioned previously, when CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=]
NDB, a tablespace and associated data file are created on each NDB
Cluster data node. You can verify that the data files were created and
obtain information about them by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
table, as shown here:

mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, STATUS, EXTRA
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
    ->     WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = 'myts';

+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| file_name    | file_type  | logfile_group_name | status | extra          |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=5 |
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=6 |
| NULL         | TABLESPACE | mylg               | NORMAL | NULL           |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

522,CREATE TRIGGER,33,"Syntax:
CREATE
    [DEFINER = user]
    TRIGGER trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event
    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
    [trigger_order]
    trigger_body

trigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }

trigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }

trigger_order: { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name

This statement creates a new trigger. A trigger is a named database
object that is associated with a table, and that activates when a
particular event occurs for the table. The trigger becomes associated
with the table named tbl_name, which must refer to a permanent table.
You cannot associate a trigger with a TEMPORARY table or a view.

Trigger names exist in the schema namespace, meaning that all triggers
must have unique names within a schema. Triggers in different schemas
can have the same name.

This section describes CREATE TRIGGER syntax. For additional
discussion, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/trigger-syntax.html.

CREATE TRIGGER requires the TRIGGER privilege for the table associated
with the trigger. If the DEFINER clause is present, the privileges
required depend on the user value, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects-security.html.
If binary logging is enabled, CREATE TRIGGER might require the SUPER
privilege, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-programs-logging.html.

The DEFINER clause determines the security context to be used when
checking access privileges at trigger activation time, as described
later in this section.

trigger_time is the trigger action time. It can be BEFORE or AFTER to
indicate that the trigger activates before or after each row to be
modified.

Basic column value checks occur prior to trigger activation, so you
cannot use BEFORE triggers to convert values inappropriate for the
column type to valid values.

trigger_event indicates the kind of operation that activates the
trigger. These trigger_event values are permitted:

o INSERT: The trigger activates whenever a new row is inserted into the
  table (for example, through INSERT, LOAD DATA, and REPLACE
  statements).

o UPDATE: The trigger activates whenever a row is modified (for
  example, through UPDATE statements).

o DELETE: The trigger activates whenever a row is deleted from the
  table (for example, through DELETE and REPLACE statements). DROP
  TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE statements on the table do not activate this
  trigger, because they do not use DELETE. Dropping a partition does
  not activate DELETE triggers, either.

523,CREATE VIEW,33,"Syntax:
CREATE
    [OR REPLACE]
    [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]
    [DEFINER = user]
    [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]
    VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
    AS select_statement
    [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]

The CREATE VIEW statement creates a new view, or replaces an existing
view if the OR REPLACE clause is given. If the view does not exist,
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does
exist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW replaces it.

For information about restrictions on view use, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/view-restrictions.html.

The select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition
of the view. (Selecting from the view selects, in effect, using the
SELECT statement.) The select_statement can select from base tables or
other views.

The view definition is ""frozen"" at creation time and is not affected by
subsequent changes to the definitions of the underlying tables. For
example, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added
to the table later do not become part of the view, and columns dropped
from the table will result in an error when selecting from the view.

The ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER
and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when
checking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK
OPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in
tables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in
this section.

The CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the
view, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT
statement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement, you must
have the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you
must also have the DROP privilege for the view. If the DEFINER clause
is present, the privileges required depend on the user value, as
discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects-security.html.

When a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later
in this section.

A view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the
default database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,
use db_name.view_name syntax to qualify the view name with the database
name:

CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;

Unqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are also
interpreted with respect to the default database. A view can refer to
tables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view name
with the appropriate database name.

Within a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a
base table and a view cannot have the same name.

Columns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to
table columns, or expressions that use functions, constant values,
operators, and so forth.

A view must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like a
base table. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the
SELECT statement are used for the view column names. To define explicit
names for the view columns, specify the optional column_list clause as
a list of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in
column_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the
SELECT statement.

A view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can
refer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and
subqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables:

CREATE VIEW v_today (today) AS SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

The following example defines a view that selects two columns from
another table as well as an expression calculated from those columns:

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);
mysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;
mysql> SELECT * FROM v;
+------+-------+-------+
| qty  | price | value |
+------+-------+-------+
|    3 |    50 |   150 |
+------+-------+-------+

A view definition is subject to the following restrictions:

o The SELECT statement cannot refer to system variables or user-defined
  variables.

o Within a stored program, the SELECT statement cannot refer to program
  parameters or local variables.

o The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.

o Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. If, after
  the view has been created, a table or view that the definition refers
  to is dropped, use of the view results in an error. To check a view
  definition for problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.

o The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot
  create a TEMPORARY view.

o You cannot associate a trigger with a view.

o Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against
  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias
  length of 256 characters).

ORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you
select from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.

For other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the
options or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the
effect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT
clause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own
LIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle
applies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that
follow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE, FOR
SHARE, LOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.

The results obtained from a view may be affected if you change the
query processing environment by changing system variables:

mysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT 'abc';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SET sql_mode = '';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT ""mycol"" FROM v;
+-------+
| mycol |
+-------+
| mycol |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SET sql_mode = 'ANSI_QUOTES';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT ""mycol"" FROM v;
+-------+
| mycol |
+-------+
| abc   |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to
use when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is
executed that references the view. The valid SQL SECURITY
characteristic values are DEFINER (the default) and INVOKER. These
indicate that the required privileges must be held by the user who
defined or invoked the view, respectively.

If the DEFINER clause is present, the user value should be a MySQL
account specified as 'user_name'@'host_name', CURRENT_USER, or
CURRENT_USER(). The permitted user values depend on the privileges you
hold, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects-security.html.
Also see that section for additional information about view security.

If the DEFINER clause is omitted, the default definer is the user who
executes the CREATE VIEW statement. This is the same as specifying
DEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.

Within a view definition, the CURRENT_USER function returns the view's
DEFINER value by default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY
INVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view's
invoker. For information about user auditing within views, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-activity-auditing.html.

Within a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER
characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine's DEFINER value. This
also affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view
definition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.

MySQL checks view privileges like this:

o At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges
  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For
  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator
  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the
  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere
  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,
  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The
  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only
  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths
  within the function might be taken.

o The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to
  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so
  forth.)

o When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by
  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER
  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY
  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.

o If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,
  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend
  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or
  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs
  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is
  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the
  view's SQL SECURITY characteristic.

Example: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function
might invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view
invokes a stored function f():

CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);

Suppose that f() contains a statement such as this:

IF name IS NULL then
  CALL p1();
ELSE
  CALL p2();
END IF;

The privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be
checked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed
for p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those
privileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess
the privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v
and the function f().

The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to
standard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for
SQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,
which is the same as the owner of the view's schema, gets applicable
privileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL
has no concept of a schema ""owner"", so MySQL adds a clause to identify
the definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to
have what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined
the view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the
view creator.

The optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It
affects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:
MERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/view-algorithms.html, as well
as
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/derived-table-optimization.html
.

Some views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such
as UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying
table. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one
relationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the
underlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a
view nonupdatable.

A generated column in a view is considered updatable because it is
possible to assign to it. However, if such a column is updated
explicitly, the only permitted value is DEFAULT. For information about
generated columns, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-generated-columns.
html.

The WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to
prevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE
clause in the select_statement is true.

In a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and
CASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is
defined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK
OPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for
underlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is
given, the default is CASCADED.

For more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION
clause, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/view-updatability.html, and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/view-check-option.html.

532,DROP TABLE,33,"Syntax:
DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS]
    tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...
    [RESTRICT | CASCADE]

DROP TABLE removes one or more tables. You must have the DROP privilege
for each table.

Be careful with this statement! For each table, it removes the table
definition and all table data. If the table is partitioned, the
statement removes the table definition, all its partitions, all data
stored in those partitions, and all partition definitions associated
with the dropped table.

Dropping a table also drops any triggers for the table.

DROP TABLE causes an implicit commit, except when used with the
TEMPORARY keyword. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

*Important*:

When a table is dropped, privileges granted specifically for the table
are not automatically dropped. They must be dropped manually. See [HELP
GRANT].

If any tables named in the argument list do not exist, DROP TABLE
behavior depends on whether the IF EXISTS clause is given:

o Without IF EXISTS, the statement fails with an error indicating which
  nonexisting tables it was unable to drop, and no changes are made.

o With IF EXISTS, no error occurs for nonexisting tables. The statement
  drops all named tables that do exist, and generates a NOTE diagnostic
  for each nonexistent table. These notes can be displayed with SHOW
  WARNINGS. See [HELP SHOW WARNINGS].

IF EXISTS can also be useful for dropping tables in unusual
circumstances under which there is an entry in the data dictionary but
no table managed by the storage engine. (For example, if an abnormal
server exit occurs after removal of the table from the storage engine
but before removal of the data dictionary entry.)

The TEMPORARY keyword has the following effects:

o The statement drops only TEMPORARY tables.

o The statement does not cause an implicit commit.

o No access rights are checked. A TEMPORARY table is visible only with
  the session that created it, so no check is necessary.

Including the TEMPORARY keyword is a good way to prevent accidentally
dropping non-TEMPORARY tables.

The RESTRICT and CASCADE keywords do nothing. They are permitted to
make porting easier from other database systems.

DROP TABLE is not supported with all innodb_force_recovery settings.

533,DROP TABLESPACE,33,"Syntax:
DROP [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]

This statement drops a tablespace that was previously created using
CREATE TABLESPACE. It is supported by the NDB and InnoDB storage
engines.

The UNDO keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, must be specified to drop
an undo tablespace. Only undo tablespaces created using CREATE UNDO
TABLESPACE syntax can be dropped. An undo tablespace must be in an
empty state before it can be dropped. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html.

ENGINE sets the storage engine that uses the tablespace, where
engine_name is the name of the storage engine. Currently, the values
InnoDB and NDB are supported. If not set, the value of
default_storage_engine is used. If it is not the same as the storage
engine used to create the tablespace, the DROP TABLESPACE statement
fails.

tablespace_name is a case-sensitive identifier in MySQL.

For an InnoDB general tablespace, all tables must be dropped from the
tablespace prior to a DROP TABLESPACE operation. If the tablespace is
not empty, DROP TABLESPACE returns an error.

An NDB tablespace to be dropped must not contain any data files; in
other words, before you can drop an NDB tablespace, you must first drop
each of its data files using ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP DATAFILE.

Notes

o A general InnoDB tablespace is not deleted automatically when the
  last table in the tablespace is dropped. The tablespace must be
  dropped explicitly using DROP TABLESPACE tablespace_name.

o A DROP DATABASE operation can drop tables that belong to a general
  tablespace but it cannot drop the tablespace, even if the operation
  drops all tables that belong to the tablespace. The tablespace must
  be dropped explicitly using DROP TABLESPACE tablespace_name.

o Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables
  stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the
  general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new
  InnoDB data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it
  is for file-per-table tablespaces.

InnoDB Examples

This example demonstrates how to drop an InnoDB general tablespace. The
general tablespace ts1 is created with a single table. Before dropping
the tablespace, the table must be dropped.

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' Engine=InnoDB;     

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 Engine=InnoDB;     

mysql> DROP TABLE t1;

mysql> DROP TABLESPACE ts1;

This example demonstrates dropping an undo tablespace. An undo
tablespace must be in an empty state before it can be dropped. For more
information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html.

mysql> DROP UNDO TABLESPACE undo_003;

NDB Example

This example shows how to drop an NDB tablespace myts having a data
file named mydata-1.dat after first creating the tablespace, and
assumes the existence of a log file group named mylg (see [HELP CREATE
LOGFILE GROUP]).

mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts
    ->     ADD DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;

You must remove all data files from the tablespace using ALTER
TABLESPACE, as shown here, before it can be dropped:

mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE myts
    ->     DROP DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;

mysql> DROP TABLESPACE myts;

534,DROP TRIGGER,33,"Syntax:
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [schema_name.]trigger_name

This statement drops a trigger. The schema (database) name is optional.
If the schema is omitted, the trigger is dropped from the default
schema. DROP TRIGGER requires the TRIGGER privilege for the table
associated with the trigger.

Use IF EXISTS to prevent an error from occurring for a trigger that
does not exist. A NOTE is generated for a nonexistent trigger when
using IF EXISTS. See [HELP SHOW WARNINGS].

Triggers for a table are also dropped if you drop the table.

535,DROP VIEW,33,"Syntax:
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS]
    view_name [, view_name] ...

DROP VIEW removes one or more views. You must have the DROP privilege
for each view.

If any views named in the argument list do not exist, the statement
fails with an error indicating by name which nonexisting views it was
unable to drop, and no changes are made.

*Note*:

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, DROP VIEW returns an error if any views named
in the argument list do not exist, but also drops all views in the list
that do exist. Due to the change in behavior in MySQL 8.0, a partially
completed DROP VIEW operation on a MySQL 5.7 master fails when
replicated on a MySQL 8.0 slave. To avoid this failure scenario, use IF
EXISTS syntax in DROP VIEW statements to prevent an error from
occurring for views that do not exist. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/atomic-ddl.html.

The IF EXISTS clause prevents an error from occurring for views that
don't exist. When this clause is given, a NOTE is generated for each
nonexistent view. See [HELP SHOW WARNINGS].

RESTRICT and CASCADE, if given, are parsed and ignored.

536,RENAME TABLE,33,"Syntax:
RENAME TABLE
    tbl_name TO new_tbl_name
    [, tbl_name2 TO new_tbl_name2] ...

RENAME TABLE renames one or more tables. You must have ALTER and DROP
privileges for the original table, and CREATE and INSERT privileges for
the new table.

For example, to rename a table named old_table to new_table, use this
statement:

RENAME TABLE old_table TO new_table;

That statement is equivalent to the following ALTER TABLE statement:

ALTER TABLE old_table RENAME new_table;

RENAME TABLE, unlike ALTER TABLE, can rename multiple tables within a
single statement:

RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             old_table2 TO new_table2,
             old_table3 TO new_table3;

Renaming operations are performed left to right. Thus, to swap two
table names, do this (assuming that a table with the intermediary name
tmp_table does not already exist):

RENAME TABLE old_table TO tmp_table,
             new_table TO old_table,
             tmp_table TO new_table;

Metadata locks on tables are acquired in name order, which in some
cases can make a difference in operation outcome when multiple
transactions execute concurrently. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/metadata-locking.html.

As of MySQL 8.0.13, you can rename tables locked with a LOCK TABLES
statement, provided that they are locked with a WRITE lock or are the
product of renaming WRITE-locked tables from earlier steps in a
multiple-table rename operation. For example, this is permitted:

LOCK TABLE old_table1 WRITE;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;

This is not permitted:

LOCK TABLE old_table1 READ;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;

Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, to execute RENAME TABLE, there must be no tables
locked with LOCK TABLES.

With the transaction table locking conditions satisfied, the rename
operation is done atomically; no other session can access any of the
tables while the rename is in progress.

If any errors occur during a RENAME TABLE, the statement fails and no
changes are made.

You can use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another:

RENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;

Using this method to move all tables from one database to a different
one in effect renames the database (an operation for which MySQL has no
single statement), except that the original database continues to
exist, albeit with no tables.

Like RENAME TABLE, ALTER TABLE ... RENAME can also be used to move a
table to a different database. Regardless of the statement used, if the
rename operation would move the table to a database located on a
different file system, the success of the outcome is platform specific
and depends on the underlying operating system calls used to move table
files.

If a table has triggers, attempts to rename the table into a different
database fail with a Trigger in wrong schema (ER_TRG_IN_WRONG_SCHEMA)
error.

An unencrypted table can be moved to an encryption-enabled database and
vice versa. However, if the table_encryption_privilege_check variable
is enabled, the TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN privilege is required if the
table encryption setting differs from the default database encryption.

To rename TEMPORARY tables, RENAME TABLE does not work. Use ALTER TABLE
instead.

RENAME TABLE works for views, except that views cannot be renamed into
a different database.

Any privileges granted specifically for a renamed table or view are not
migrated to the new name. They must be changed manually.

RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name changes internally generated
foreign key constraint names and user-defined foreign key constraint
names that begin with the string ""tbl_name_ibfk_"" to reflect the new
table name. InnoDB interprets foreign key constraint names that begin
with the string ""tbl_name_ibfk_"" as internally generated names.

Foreign key constraint names that point to the renamed table are
automatically updated unless there is a conflict, in which case the
statement fails with an error. A conflict occurs if the renamed
constraint name already exists. In such cases, you must drop and
re-create the foreign keys for them to function properly.

RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name changes internally generated and
user-defined CHECK constraint names that begin with the string
""tbl_name_chk_"" to reflect the new table name. MySQL interprets CHECK
constraint names that begin with the string ""tbl_name_chk_"" as
internally generated names. Example:

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t1
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

mysql> RENAME TABLE t1 TO t3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t3\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t3
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t3` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,

537,TRUNCATE TABLE,33,"Syntax:
TRUNCATE [TABLE] tbl_name

TRUNCATE TABLE empties a table completely. It requires the DROP
privilege. Logically, TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to a DELETE statement
that deletes all rows, or a sequence of DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE
statements.

To achieve high performance, TRUNCATE TABLE bypasses the DML method of
deleting data. Thus, it does not cause ON DELETE triggers to fire, it
cannot be performed for InnoDB tables with parent-child foreign key
relationships, and it cannot be rolled back like a DML operation.
However, TRUNCATE TABLE operations on tables that use an atomic
DDL-supported storage engine are either fully committed or rolled back
if the server halts during their operation. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/atomic-ddl.html.

Although TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to DELETE, it is classified as a DDL
statement rather than a DML statement. It differs from DELETE in the
following ways:

o Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much
  faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly for large tables.

o Truncate operations cause an implicit commit, and so cannot be rolled
  back. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

o Truncation operations cannot be performed if the session holds an
  active table lock.

o TRUNCATE TABLE fails for an InnoDB table or NDB table if there are
  any FOREIGN KEY constraints from other tables that reference the
  table. Foreign key constraints between columns of the same table are
  permitted.

o Truncation operations do not return a meaningful value for the number
  of deleted rows. The usual result is ""0 rows affected,"" which should
  be interpreted as ""no information.""

o As long as the table definition is valid, the table can be re-created
  as an empty table with TRUNCATE TABLE, even if the data or index
  files have become corrupted.

o Any AUTO_INCREMENT value is reset to its start value. This is true
  even for MyISAM and InnoDB, which normally do not reuse sequence
  values.

o When used with partitioned tables, TRUNCATE TABLE preserves the
  partitioning; that is, the data and index files are dropped and
  re-created, while the partition definitions are unaffected.

o The TRUNCATE TABLE statement does not invoke ON DELETE triggers.

o Truncating a corrupted InnoDB table is supported.

538,CALL,34,"Syntax:
CALL sp_name([parameter[,...]])
CALL sp_name[()]

The CALL statement invokes a stored procedure that was defined
previously with CREATE PROCEDURE.

Stored procedures that take no arguments can be invoked without
parentheses. That is, CALL p() and CALL p are equivalent.

CALL can pass back values to its caller using parameters that are
declared as OUT or INOUT parameters. When the procedure returns, a
client program can also obtain the number of rows affected for the
final statement executed within the routine: At the SQL level, call the
ROW_COUNT() function; from the C API, call the mysql_affected_rows()
function.

539,DELETE,34,"Syntax:
DELETE is a DML statement that removes rows from a table.

A DELETE statement can start with a WITH clause to define common table
expressions accessible within the DELETE. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html.

Single-Table Syntax

DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE] FROM tbl_name [[AS] tbl_alias]
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY ...]
    [LIMIT row_count]

The DELETE statement deletes rows from tbl_name and returns the number
of deleted rows. To check the number of deleted rows, call the
ROW_COUNT() function described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html.

Main Clauses

The conditions in the optional WHERE clause identify which rows to
delete. With no WHERE clause, all rows are deleted.

where_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to
be deleted. It is specified as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html.

If the ORDER BY clause is specified, the rows are deleted in the order
that is specified. The LIMIT clause places a limit on the number of
rows that can be deleted. These clauses apply to single-table deletes,
but not multi-table deletes.

Multiple-Table Syntax

DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]
    tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...
    FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]

DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]
    FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...
    USING table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]

Privileges

You need the DELETE privilege on a table to delete rows from it. You
need only the SELECT privilege for any columns that are only read, such
as those named in the WHERE clause.

Performance

When you do not need to know the number of deleted rows, the TRUNCATE
TABLE statement is a faster way to empty a table than a DELETE
statement with no WHERE clause. Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE cannot be
used within a transaction or if you have a lock on the table. See [HELP
TRUNCATE TABLE] and [HELP LOCK TABLES].

The speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors
discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete-optimization.html.

To ensure that a given DELETE statement does not take too much time,
the MySQL-specific LIMIT row_count clause for DELETE specifies the
maximum number of rows to be deleted. If the number of rows to delete
is larger than the limit, repeat the DELETE statement until the number
of affected rows is less than the LIMIT value.

Subqueries

You cannot delete from a table and select from the same table in a
subquery.

Partitioned Table Support

DELETE supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION
option, which takes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more
partitions or subpartitions (or both) from which to select rows to be
dropped. Partitions not included in the list are ignored. Given a
partitioned table t with a partition named p0, executing the statement
DELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) has the same effect on the table as
executing ALTER TABLE t TRUNCATE PARTITION (p0); in both cases, all
rows in partition p0 are dropped.

PARTITION can be used along with a WHERE condition, in which case the
condition is tested only on rows in the listed partitions. For example,
DELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) WHERE c < 5 deletes rows only from
partition p0 for which the condition c < 5 is true; rows in any other
partitions are not checked and thus not affected by the DELETE.

The PARTITION option can also be used in multiple-table DELETE
statements. You can use up to one such option per table named in the
FROM option.

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

540,DO,34,"Syntax:
DO expr [, expr] ...

DO executes the expressions but does not return any results. In most
respects, DO is shorthand for SELECT expr, ..., but has the advantage
that it is slightly faster when you do not care about the result.

DO is useful primarily with functions that have side effects, such as
RELEASE_LOCK().

Example: This SELECT statement pauses, but also produces a result set:

mysql> SELECT SLEEP(5);
+----------+
| SLEEP(5) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (5.02 sec)

DO, on the other hand, pauses without producing a result set.:

mysql> DO SLEEP(5);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (4.99 sec)

This could be useful, for example in a stored function or trigger,
which prohibit statements that produce result sets.

DO only executes expressions. It cannot be used in all cases where
SELECT can be used. For example, DO id FROM t1 is invalid because it
references a table.

542,IMPORT TABLE,34,"Syntax:
IMPORT TABLE FROM sdi_file [, sdi_file] ...

The IMPORT TABLE statement imports MyISAM tables based on information
contained in .sdi (serialized dictionary information) metadata files.
IMPORT TABLE requires the FILE privilege to read the .sdi and table
content files, and the CREATE privilege for the table to be created.

Tables can be exported from one server using mysqldump to write a file
of SQL statements and imported into another server using mysql to
process the dump file. IMPORT TABLE provides a faster alternative using
the ""raw"" table files.

Prior to import, the files that provide the table content must be
placed in the appropriate schema directory for the import server, and
the .sdi file must be located in a directory accessible to the server.
For example, the .sdi file can be placed in the directory named by the
secure_file_priv system variable, or (if secure_file_priv is empty) in
a directory under the server data directory.

The following example describes how to export MyISAM tables named
employees and managers from the hr schema of one server and import them
into the hr schema of another server. The example uses these
assumptions (to perform a similar operation on your own system, modify
the path names as appropriate):

o For the export server, export_basedir represents its base directory,
  and its data directory is export_basedir/data.

o For the import server, import_basedir represents its base directory,
  and its data directory is import_basedir/data.

o Table files are exported from the export server into the /tmp/export
  directory and this directory is secure (not accessible to other
  users).

o The import server uses /tmp/mysql-files as the directory named by its
  secure_file_priv system variable.

To export tables from the export server, use this procedure:

1. Ensure a consistent snapshot by executing this statement to lock the
   tables so that they cannot be modified during export:

mysql> FLUSH TABLES hr.employees, hr.managers WITH READ LOCK;

   While the lock is in effect, the tables can still be used, but only
   for read access.

2. At the file system level, copy the .sdi and table content files from
   the hr schema directory to the secure export directory:

  o The .sdi file is located in the hr schema directory, but might not
    have exactly the same basename as the table name. For example, the
    .sdi files for the employees and managers tables might be named
    employees_125.sdi and managers_238.sdi.

  o For a MyISAM table, the content files are its .MYD data file and
    .MYI index file.

   Given those file names, the copy commands look like this:

shell> cd export_basedir/data/hr
shell> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/export
shell> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/export
shell> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export
shell> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export

3. Unlock the tables:

mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;

To import tables into the import server, use this procedure:

1. The import schema must exist. If necessary, execute this statement
   to create it:

mysql> CREATE SCHEMA hr;

2. At the file system level, copy the .sdi files to the import server
   secure_file_priv directory, /tmp/mysql-files. Also, copy the table
   content files to the hr schema directory:

shell> cd /tmp/export
shell> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
shell> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
shell> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr
shell> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr

3. Import the tables by executing an IMPORT TABLE statement that names
   the .sdi files:

mysql> IMPORT TABLE FROM
       '/tmp/mysql-files/employees.sdi',
       '/tmp/mysql-files/managers.sdi';

The .sdi file need not be placed in the import server directory named
by the secure_file_priv system variable if that variable is empty; it
can be in any directory accessible to the server, including the schema
directory for the imported table. If the .sdi file is placed in that
directory, however, it may be rewritten; the import operation creates a
new .sdi file for the table, which will overwrite the old .sdi file if
the operation uses the same file name for the new file.

Each sdi_file value must be a string literal that names the .sdi file
for a table or is a pattern that matches .sdi files. If the string is a
pattern, any leading directory path and the .sdi file name suffix must
be given literally. Pattern characters are permitted only in the base
name part of the file name:

o ? matches any single character

o * matches any sequence of characters, including no characters

Using a pattern, the previous IMPORT TABLE statement could have been
written like this (assuming that the /tmp/mysql-files directory
contains no other .sdi files matching the pattern):

IMPORT TABLE FROM '/tmp/mysql-files/*.sdi';

To interpret the location of .sdi file path names, the server uses the
same rules for IMPORT TABLE as the server-side rules for LOAD DATA

attention to the rules used to interpret relative path names.

IMPORT TABLE fails if the .sdi or table files cannot be located. After
importing a table, the server attempts to open it and reports as
warnings any problems detected. To attempt a repair to correct any
reported issues, use REPAIR TABLE.

INSERT inserts new rows into an existing table. The INSERT ... VALUES
and INSERT ... SET forms of the statement insert rows based on
explicitly specified values. The INSERT ... SELECT form inserts rows
selected from another table or tables. INSERT with an ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE clause enables existing rows to be updated if a row to be
inserted would cause a duplicate value in a UNIQUE index or PRIMARY
KEY.

For additional information about INSERT ... SELECT and INSERT ... ON
DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, see [HELP INSERT SELECT], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html.

In MySQL 8.0, the DELAYED keyword is accepted but ignored by the
server. For the reasons for this, see [HELP INSERT DELAYED],

Inserting into a table requires the INSERT privilege for the table. If
the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause is used and a duplicate key causes
an UPDATE to be performed instead, the statement requires the UPDATE
privilege for the columns to be updated. For columns that are read but
not modified you need only the SELECT privilege (such as for a column
referenced only on the right hand side of an col_name=expr assignment
in an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause).

When inserting into a partitioned table, you can control which
partitions and subpartitions accept new rows. The PARTITION option
takes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more partitions or
subpartitions (or both) of the table. If any of the rows to be inserted
by a given INSERT statement do not match one of the partitions listed,
the INSERT statement fails with the error Found a row not matching the
given partition set. For more information and examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

545,INSERT DELAYED,34,"Syntax:
INSERT DELAYED ...

The DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a MySQL extension to
standard SQL. In previous versions of MySQL, it can be used for certain
kinds of tables (such as MyISAM), such that when a client uses INSERT
DELAYED, it gets an okay from the server at once, and the row is queued
to be inserted when the table is not in use by any other thread.

DELAYED inserts and replaces were deprecated in MySQL 5.6. In MySQL
8.0, DELAYED is not supported. The server recognizes but ignores the
DELAYED keyword, handles the insert as a nondelayed insert, and
generates an ER_WARN_LEGACY_SYNTAX_CONVERTED warning (""INSERT DELAYED
is no longer supported. The statement was converted to INSERT""). The
DELAYED keyword is scheduled for removal in a future release.

The LOAD DATA statement reads rows from a text file into a table at a
very high speed. LOAD DATA is the complement of SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE. (See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select-into.html.) To write
data from a table to a file, use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. To read the
file back into a table, use LOAD DATA. The syntax of the FIELDS and
LINES clauses is the same for both statements.

You can also load data files by using the mysqlimport utility; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlimport.html. mysqlimport
operates by sending a LOAD DATA statement to the server.

        [, field_name_or_user_var] ...)]
    [SET col_name={expr | DEFAULT},
        [, col_name={expr | DEFAULT}] ...]

The LOAD XML statement reads data from an XML file into a table. The
file_name must be given as a literal string. The tagname in the
optional ROWS IDENTIFIED BY clause must also be given as a literal
string, and must be surrounded by angle brackets (< and >).

LOAD XML acts as the complement of running the mysql client in XML
output mode (that is, starting the client with the --xml option). To
write data from a table to an XML file, you can invoke the mysql client
with the --xml and -e options from the system shell, as shown here:

shell> mysql --xml -e 'SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable' > file.xml

To read the file back into a table, use LOAD XML. By default, the <row>
element is considered to be the equivalent of a database table row;
this can be changed using the ROWS IDENTIFIED BY clause.

This statement supports three different XML formats:

o Column names as attributes and column values as attribute values:

<row column1=""value1"" column2=""value2"" .../>

o Column names as tags and column values as the content of these tags:

<row>
  <column1>value1</column1>
  <column2>value2</column2>
</row>

o Column names are the name attributes of <field> tags, and values are
  the contents of these tags:

<row>
  <field name='column1'>value1</field>
  <field name='column2'>value2</field>
</row>

  This is the format used by other MySQL tools, such as mysqldump.

All three formats can be used in the same XML file; the import routine
automatically detects the format for each row and interprets it
correctly. Tags are matched based on the tag or attribute name and the
column name.

The following clauses work essentially the same way for LOAD XML as
they do for LOAD DATA:

o LOW_PRIORITY or CONCURRENT

o LOCAL

o REPLACE or IGNORE

o CHARACTER SET

o SET

See [HELP LOAD DATA], for more information about these clauses.

(field_name_or_user_var, ...) is a list of one or more comma-separated
XML fields or user variables. The name of a user variable used for this
purpose must match the name of a field from the XML file, prefixed with
@. You can use field names to select only desired fields. User
variables can be employed to store the corresponding field values for
subsequent re-use.

The IGNORE number LINES or IGNORE number ROWS clause causes the first
number rows in the XML file to be skipped. It is analogous to the LOAD
DATA statement's IGNORE ... LINES clause.

REPLACE works exactly like INSERT, except that if an old row in the
table has the same value as a new row for a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE
index, the old row is deleted before the new row is inserted. See [HELP
INSERT].

REPLACE is a MySQL extension to the SQL standard. It either inserts, or
deletes and inserts. For another MySQL extension to standard SQL---that
either inserts or updates---see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html.

DELAYED inserts and replaces were deprecated in MySQL 5.6. In MySQL
8.0, DELAYED is not supported. The server recognizes but ignores the
DELAYED keyword, handles the replace as a nondelayed replace, and
generates an ER_WARN_LEGACY_SYNTAX_CONVERTED warning. (""REPLACE DELAYED
is no longer supported. The statement was converted to REPLACE."") The
DELAYED keyword will be removed in a future release.

*Note*:

REPLACE makes sense only if a table has a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index.
Otherwise, it becomes equivalent to INSERT, because there is no index
to be used to determine whether a new row duplicates another.

Values for all columns are taken from the values specified in the
REPLACE statement. Any missing columns are set to their default values,
just as happens for INSERT. You cannot refer to values from the current
row and use them in the new row. If you use an assignment such as SET
col_name = col_name + 1, the reference to the column name on the right
hand side is treated as DEFAULT(col_name), so the assignment is
equivalent to SET col_name = DEFAULT(col_name) + 1.

To use REPLACE, you must have both the INSERT and DELETE privileges for
the table.

If a generated column is replaced explicitly, the only permitted value
is DEFAULT. For information about generated columns, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-generated-columns.
html.

REPLACE supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION
keyword with a list of comma-separated names of partitions,
subpartitions, or both. As with INSERT, if it is not possible to insert
the new row into any of these partitions or subpartitions, the REPLACE
statement fails with the error Found a row not matching the given
partition set. For more information and examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/subqueries.html. A SELECT
statement can start with a WITH clause to define common table
expressions accessible within the SELECT. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o SELECT supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION with
  a list of partitions or subpartitions (or both) following the name of
  the table in a table_reference (see [HELP JOIN]). In this case, rows
  are selected only from the partitions listed, and any other
  partitions of the table are ignored. For more information and
  examples, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

  SELECT ... PARTITION from tables using storage engines such as MyISAM
  that perform table-level locks (and thus partition locks) lock only
  the partitions or subpartitions named by the PARTITION option.

  For more information, see Partitioning and Locking
  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-limitations-loc
  king.html).

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/expressions.html, and
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

A table reference is also known as a join expression.

A table reference (when it refers to a partitioned table) may contain a
PARTITION option, including a list of comma-separated partitions,
subpartitions, or both. This option follows the name of the table and
precedes any alias declaration. The effect of this option is that rows
are selected only from the listed partitions or subpartitions. Any
partitions or subpartitions not named in the list are ignored. For more
information and examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

The syntax of table_factor is extended in MySQL in comparison with
standard SQL. The standard accepts only table_reference, not a list of
them inside a pair of parentheses.

This is a conservative extension if each comma in a list of
table_reference items is considered as equivalent to an inner join. For
example:

SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)

is equivalent to:

SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)

In MySQL, JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and INNER JOIN are syntactic equivalents
(they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they are not
equivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used
otherwise.

In general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing
only inner join operations. MySQL also supports nested joins. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/nested-join-optimization.html.

Index hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer makes
use of indexes. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-hints.html. Optimizer
hints and the optimizer_switch system variable are other ways to
influence optimizer use of indexes. See

553,UPDATE,34,"Syntax:
UPDATE is a DML statement that modifies rows in a table.

An UPDATE statement can start with a WITH clause to define common table
expressions accessible within the UPDATE. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html.

Single-table syntax:

UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] table_reference
    SET assignment_list
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY ...]
    [LIMIT row_count]

value:
    {expr | DEFAULT}

assignment:
    col_name = value

assignment_list:
    assignment [, assignment] ...

Multiple-table syntax:

UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] table_references
    SET assignment_list
    [WHERE where_condition]

For the single-table syntax, the UPDATE statement updates columns of
existing rows in the named table with new values. The SET clause
indicates which columns to modify and the values they should be given.
Each value can be given as an expression, or the keyword DEFAULT to set
a column explicitly to its default value. The WHERE clause, if given,
specifies the conditions that identify which rows to update. With no
WHERE clause, all rows are updated. If the ORDER BY clause is
specified, the rows are updated in the order that is specified. The
LIMIT clause places a limit on the number of rows that can be updated.

For the multiple-table syntax, UPDATE updates rows in each table named
in table_references that satisfy the conditions. Each matching row is
updated once, even if it matches the conditions multiple times. For
multiple-table syntax, ORDER BY and LIMIT cannot be used.

For partitioned tables, both the single-single and multiple-table forms
of this statement support the use of a PARTITION option as part of a
table reference. This option takes a list of one or more partitions or
subpartitions (or both). Only the partitions (or subpartitions) listed
are checked for matches, and a row that is not in any of these
partitions or subpartitions is not updated, whether it satisfies the
where_condition or not.

*Note*:

Unlike the case when using PARTITION with an INSERT or REPLACE
statement, an otherwise valid UPDATE ... PARTITION statement is
considered successful even if no rows in the listed partitions (or
subpartitions) match the where_condition.

For more information and examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

where_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to
be updated. For expression syntax, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/expressions.html.

table_references and where_condition are specified as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html.

You need the UPDATE privilege only for columns referenced in an UPDATE
that are actually updated. You need only the SELECT privilege for any
columns that are read but not modified.

The UPDATE statement supports the following modifiers:

o With the LOW_PRIORITY modifier, execution of the UPDATE is delayed
  until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects only
  storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,
  MEMORY, and MERGE).

o With the IGNORE modifier, the update statement does not abort even if
  errors occur during the update. Rows for which duplicate-key
  conflicts occur on a unique key value are not updated. Rows updated
  to values that would cause data conversion errors are updated to the
  closest valid values instead. For more information, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#ignore-strict-c

  | READ ONLY
}

BEGIN [WORK]
COMMIT [WORK] [AND [NO] CHAIN] [[NO] RELEASE]
ROLLBACK [WORK] [AND [NO] CHAIN] [[NO] RELEASE]
SET autocommit = {0 | 1}

These statements provide control over use of transactions:

o START TRANSACTION or BEGIN start a new transaction.

o COMMIT commits the current transaction, making its changes permanent.

o ROLLBACK rolls back the current transaction, canceling its changes.

o SET autocommit disables or enables the default autocommit mode for
  the current session.

By default, MySQL runs with autocommit mode enabled. This means that,
when not otherwise inside a transaction, each statement is atomic, as
if it were surrounded by START TRANSACTION and COMMIT. You cannot use
ROLLBACK to undo the effect; however, if an error occurs during
statement execution, the statement is rolled back.

To disable autocommit mode implicitly for a single series of
statements, use the START TRANSACTION statement:

START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summary=@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;

With START TRANSACTION, autocommit remains disabled until you end the
transaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. The autocommit mode then reverts
to its previous state.

START TRANSACTION permits several modifiers that control transaction
characteristics. To specify multiple modifiers, separate them by
commas.

o The WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT modifier starts a consistent read for
  storage engines that are capable of it. This applies only to InnoDB.
  The effect is the same as issuing a START TRANSACTION followed by a
  SELECT from any InnoDB table. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.
  The WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT modifier does not change the current
  transaction isolation level, so it provides a consistent snapshot
  only if the current isolation level is one that permits a consistent
  read. The only isolation level that permits a consistent read is
  REPEATABLE READ. For all other isolation levels, the WITH CONSISTENT
  SNAPSHOT clause is ignored. A warning is generated when the WITH
  CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT clause is ignored.

o The READ WRITE and READ ONLY modifiers set the transaction access
  mode. They permit or prohibit changes to tables used in the
  transaction. The READ ONLY restriction prevents the transaction from
  modifying or locking both transactional and nontransactional tables
  that are visible to other transactions; the transaction can still
  modify or lock temporary tables.

  MySQL enables extra optimizations for queries on InnoDB tables when
  the transaction is known to be read-only. Specifying READ ONLY
  ensures these optimizations are applied in cases where the read-only
  status cannot be determined automatically. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-performance-ro-txn.htm
  l for more information.

  If no access mode is specified, the default mode applies. Unless the
  default has been changed, it is read/write. It is not permitted to

  In read-only mode, it remains possible to change tables created with
  the TEMPORARY keyword using DML statements. Changes made with DDL

  For additional information about transaction access mode, including

  If the read_only system variable is enabled, explicitly starting a

*Important*:

Many APIs used for writing MySQL client applications (such as JDBC)
provide their own methods for starting transactions that can (and
sometimes should) be used instead of sending a START TRANSACTION
statement from the client. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connectors-apis.html, or the
documentation for your API, for more information.

To disable autocommit mode explicitly, use the following statement:

SET autocommit=0;

After disabling autocommit mode by setting the autocommit variable to
zero, changes to transaction-safe tables (such as those for InnoDB or
NDB) are not made permanent immediately. You must use COMMIT to store
your changes to disk or ROLLBACK to ignore the changes.

autocommit is a session variable and must be set for each session. To
disable autocommit mode for each new connection, see the description of
the autocommit system variable at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html.

BEGIN and BEGIN WORK are supported as aliases of START TRANSACTION for
initiating a transaction. START TRANSACTION is standard SQL syntax, is
the recommended way to start an ad-hoc transaction, and permits
modifiers that BEGIN does not.

The BEGIN statement differs from the use of the BEGIN keyword that
starts a BEGIN ... END compound statement. The latter does not begin a
transaction. See [HELP BEGIN END].

*Note*:

Within all stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers,
and events), the parser treats BEGIN [WORK] as the beginning of a BEGIN
... END block. Begin a transaction in this context with START
TRANSACTION instead.

The optional WORK keyword is supported for COMMIT and ROLLBACK, as are
the CHAIN and RELEASE clauses. CHAIN and RELEASE can be used for
additional control over transaction completion. The value of the
completion_type system variable determines the default completion
behavior. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html.

The AND CHAIN clause causes a new transaction to begin as soon as the
current one ends, and the new transaction has the same isolation level
as the just-terminated transaction. The new transaction also uses the
same access mode (READ WRITE or READ ONLY) as the just-terminated
transaction. The RELEASE clause causes the server to disconnect the
current client session after terminating the current transaction.
Including the NO keyword suppresses CHAIN or RELEASE completion, which
can be useful if the completion_type system variable is set to cause
chaining or release completion by default.

To disable autocommit mode implicitly for a single series of

  The WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT modifier does not change the current
  transaction isolation level, so it provides a consistent snapshot
  only if the current isolation level is one that permits a consistent

  REPEATABLE READ. For all other isolation levels, the WITH CONSISTENT

BACKUP_ADMIN privilege. The BACKUP_ADMIN privilege is automatically
granted to users with the RELOAD privilege when performing an in-place
upgrade to MySQL 8.0 from an earlier version.

Multiple sessions can hold a backup lock simultaneously.

UNLOCK INSTANCE releases a backup lock held by the current session. A
backup lock held by a session is also released if the session is
terminated.

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP prevents files from being created, renamed, or
removed. REPAIR TABLE TRUNCATE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, and account
management statements are blocked. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-management-statements.h
tml. Operations that modify InnoDB files that are not recorded in the
InnoDB redo log are also blocked.

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP permits DDL operations that only affect
user-created temporary tables. In effect, files that belong to
user-created temporary tables can be created, renamed, or removed while
a backup lock is held. Creation of binary log files is also permitted.

A backup lock acquired by LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP is independent of
transactional locks and locks taken by FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [,

UNLOCK TABLES

MySQL enables client sessions to acquire table locks explicitly for the
purpose of cooperating with other sessions for access to tables, or to
prevent other sessions from modifying tables during periods when a
session requires exclusive access to them. A session can acquire or
release locks only for itself. One session cannot acquire locks for
another session or release locks held by another session.

Locks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed when
updating tables. This is explained in more detail in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-re
strictions.

LOCK TABLES explicitly acquires table locks for the current client
session. Table locks can be acquired for base tables or views. You must
have the LOCK TABLES privilege, and the SELECT privilege for each
object to be locked.

For view locking, LOCK TABLES adds all base tables used in the view to
the set of tables to be locked and locks them automatically. If you
lock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables used in triggers
are also locked implicitly, as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-an
d-triggers.

If you lock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables related by
a foreign key constraint are opened and locked implicitly. For foreign
key checks, a shared read-only lock (LOCK TABLES READ) is taken on
related tables. For cascading updates, a shared-nothing write lock
(LOCK TABLES WRITE) is taken on related tables that are involved in the
operation.

UNLOCK TABLES explicitly releases any table locks held by the current
session. LOCK TABLES implicitly releases any table locks held by the
current session before acquiring new locks.

Another use for UNLOCK TABLES is to release the global read lock
acquired with the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK statement, which enables
you to lock all tables in all databases. See [HELP FLUSH]. (This is a
very convenient way to get backups if you have a file system such as
Veritas that can take snapshots in time.)

XA END xid [SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]]

XA PREPARE xid

XA ROLLBACK xid

XA RECOVER [CONVERT XID]

For XA START, the JOIN and RESUME clauses are recognized but have no
effect.

For XA END the SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE] clause is recognized but has no
effect.

Each XA statement begins with the XA keyword, and most of them require
an xid value. An xid is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates
which transaction the statement applies to. xid values are supplied by
the client, or generated by the MySQL server. An xid value has from one
to three parts:

xid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]

gtrid is a global transaction identifier, bqual is a branch qualifier,
and formatID is a number that identifies the format used by the gtrid
and bqual values. As indicated by the syntax, bqual and formatID are
optional. The default bqual value is '' if not given. The default
formatID value is 1 if not given.

gtrid and bqual must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not
characters) long. gtrid and bqual can be specified in several ways. You
can use a quoted string ('ab'), hex string (X'6162', 0x6162), or bit
value (b'nnnn').

formatID is an unsigned integer.

The gtrid and bqual values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL
server's underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL
statement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works
with some specific character set. To be safe, write gtrid and bqual as
hex strings.

xid values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values
generated by one TM must be different from values generated by other
TMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own xid values in a list
of values returned by the XA RECOVER statement.

XA START xid starts an XA transaction with the given xid value. Each XA
transaction must have a unique xid value, so the value must not
currently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed
using the gtrid and bqual values. All following XA statements for the
XA transaction must be specified using the same xid value as that given
in the XA START statement. If you use any of those statements but
specify an xid value that does not correspond to some existing XA
transaction, an error occurs.

One or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction.
All XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same
gtrid value in the xid value. For this reason, gtrid values must be
globally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global
transaction a given XA transaction is part of. The bqual part of the
xid value must be different for each XA transaction within a global
transaction. (The requirement that bqual values be different is a
limitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of
the XA specification.)

The XA RECOVER statement returns information for those XA transactions
on the MySQL server that are in the PREPARED state. (See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/xa-states.html.) The output
includes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless
of which client started it.

XA RECOVER requires the XA_RECOVER_ADMIN privilege. This privilege
requirement prevents users from discovering the XID values for
outstanding prepared XA transactions other than their own. It does not
affect normal commit or rollback of an XA transaction because the user
who started it knows its XID.

XA RECOVER output rows look like this (for an example xid value
consisting of the parts 'abc', 'def', and 7):

mysql> XA RECOVER;
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+
| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+
|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+

The output columns have the following meanings:

o formatID is the formatID part of the transaction xid

o gtrid_length is the length in bytes of the gtrid part of the xid

o bqual_length is the length in bytes of the bqual part of the xid

o data is the concatenation of the gtrid and bqual parts of the xid

XID values may contain nonprintable characters. XA RECOVER permits an
optional CONVERT XID clause so that clients can request XID values in
hexadecimal.

567,RESET MASTER,35,"Syntax:
RESET MASTER [TO binary_log_file_index_number]

*Warning*:

Use this statement with caution to ensure you do not lose any wanted
binary log file data and GTID execution history.

RESET MASTER requires the RELOAD privilege.

For a server where binary logging is enabled (log_bin is ON), RESET
MASTER deletes all existing binary log files and resets the binary log
index file, resetting the server to its state before binary logging was
started. A new empty binary log file is created so that binary logging
can be restarted.

For a server where GTIDs are in use (gtid_mode is ON), issuing RESET
MASTER resets the GTID execution history. The value of the gtid_purged
system variable is set to an empty string (''), the global value (but
not the session value) of the gtid_executed system variable is set to
an empty string, and the mysql.gtid_executed table is cleared (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids-concepts.html
#replication-gtids-gtid-executed-table). If the GTID-enabled server has
binary logging enabled, RESET MASTER also resets the binary log as
described above. Note that RESET MASTER is the method to reset the GTID
execution history even if the GTID-enabled server is a replication
slave where binary logging is disabled; RESET SLAVE has no effect on
the GTID execution history. For more information on resetting the GTID
execution history, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids-lifecycle.htm
l#replication-gtids-execution-history.

Issuing RESET MASTER without the optional TO clause deletes all binary
log files listed in the index file, resets the binary log index file to
be empty, and creates a new binary log file starting at 1. Use the
optional TO clause to start the binary log file index from a number
other than 1 after the reset.

Using RESET MASTER with the TO clause to specify a binary log file
index number to start from simplifies failover by providing a single
statement alternative to the FLUSH BINARY LOGS and PURGE BINARY LOGS TO
statements. Check that you are using a reasonable value for the index
number. If you enter an incorrect value, you can correct this by
issuing another RESET MASTER statement with or without the TO clause.
If you do not correct a value that is out of range, the server cannot
be restarted.

The following example demonstrates TO clause usage:

RESET MASTER TO 1234;

SHOW BINARY LOGS;
+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Log_name          | File_size | Encrypted |

568,SET SQL_LOG_BIN,35,"Syntax:
SET sql_log_bin = {OFF|ON}

The sql_log_bin variable controls whether logging to the binary log is
enabled for the current session (assuming that the binary log itself is
enabled). The default value is ON. To disable or enable binary logging
for the current session, set the session sql_log_bin variable to OFF or
ON.

Set this variable to OFF for a session to temporarily disable binary
logging while making changes to the master you do not want replicated
to the slave.

Setting the session value of this system variable is a restricted
operation. The session user must have privileges sufficient to set
restricted session variables. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/system-variable-privileges.html
.

It is not possible to set the session value of sql_log_bin within a
transaction or subquery.

Setting this variable to OFF prevents new GTIDs from being assigned to
transactions in the binary log. If you are using GTIDs for replication,
this means that even when binary logging is later enabled again, the
GTIDs written into the log from this point do not account for any
transactions that occurred in the meantime, so in effect those
transactions are lost.

mysqldump adds a SET @@SESSION.sql_log_bin=0 statement to a dump file
from a server where GTIDs are in use, which disables binary logging
while the dump file is being reloaded. The statement prevents new GTIDs
from being generated and assigned to the transactions in the dump file
as they are executed, so that the original GTIDs for the transactions
are used.

CHANGE MASTER TO changes the parameters that the slave server uses for
connecting to the master server, for reading the master binary log, and
reading the slave relay log. It also updates the contents of the master
info and relay log info repositories (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/slave-logs.html). CHANGE MASTER
TO requires the REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

You can issue CHANGE MASTER TO statements on a running slave without
first stopping it, depending on the states of the slave SQL thread and
slave I/O thread. The rules governing such use are provided later in
this section.

When using a multithreaded slave (in other words slave_parallel_workers
is greater than 0), stopping the slave can cause ""gaps"" in the sequence
of transactions that have been executed from the relay log, regardless
of whether the slave was stopped intentionally or otherwise. When such
gaps exist, issuing CHANGE MASTER TO fails. The solution in this
situation is to issue START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS which
ensures that the gaps are closed.

The optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which
replication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL
channel clause applies the CHANGE MASTER TO statement to a specific
replication channel, and is used to add a new channel or modify an
existing channel. For example, to add a new channel called channel2:

CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1, MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2'

If no clause is named and no extra channels exist, the statement
applies to the default channel.

When using multiple replication channels, if a CHANGE MASTER TO
statement does not name a channel using a FOR CHANNEL channel clause,
an error occurs. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-channels.html for
more information.

Options not specified retain their value, except as indicated in the
following discussion. Thus, in most cases, there is no need to specify
options that do not change.

MASTER_HOST, MASTER_USER, MASTER_PASSWORD, and MASTER_PORT provide
information to the slave about how to connect to its master:

o MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the host name (or IP address) of the
  master host and its TCP/IP port.

  *Note*:

  Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to connect
  to the master MySQL server using TCP/IP.

  If you specify the MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT option, the slave
  assumes that the master server is different from before (even if the
  option value is the same as its current value.) In this case, the old
  values for the master binary log file name and position are
  considered no longer applicable, so if you do not specify
  MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the statement,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.

  Setting MASTER_HOST='' (that is, setting its value explicitly to an
  empty string) is not the same as not setting MASTER_HOST at all.
  Trying to set MASTER_HOST to an empty string fails with an error.

  Values used for MASTER_HOST and other CHANGE MASTER TO options are
  checked for linefeed (\n or 0x0A) characters; the presence of such
  characters in these values causes the statement to fail with
  ER_MASTER_INFO. (Bug #11758581, Bug #50801)

o MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user name and password of the
  account to use for connecting to the master.

  MASTER_USER cannot be made empty; setting MASTER_USER = '' or leaving
  it unset when setting a value for MASTER_PASSWORD causes an error
  (Bug #13427949).

  The password used for a MySQL Replication slave account in a CHANGE
  MASTER TO statement is limited to 32 characters in length; trying to
  use a password of more than 32 characters causes CHANGE MASTER TO to
  fail.

  The text of a running CHANGE MASTER TO statement, including values
  for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD, can be seen in the output of a
  concurrent SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. (The complete text of a START
  SLAVE statement is also visible to SHOW PROCESSLIST.)

PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER (available as of MySQL 8.0.18) names a user
account that supplies a security context for the specified channel.
NULL, which is the default, means no security context is used. If you
do not specify a channel and no other channels exist, the statement is
applied to the default channel. For example, to start privilege checks
on the channel channel_1 on a running replication slave, issue the
following statements:

mysql> STOP SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER = 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com' FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1'; 
mysql> START SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';

The user name and host name for the user account must follow the syntax
described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html, and the
user must not be an anonymous user (with a blank user name) or the
CURRENT_USER. The account must have the REPLICATION_APPLIER privilege,
plus the required privileges to execute the transactions replicated on
the channel. When you restart the replication channel, the privilege
checks are applied from that point on. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-privilege-checks.ht
ml.

MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS and MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
(available as of MySQL 8.0.18) enable control over the use of
compression for connections to the master:

o MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS specifies the permitted compression
  algorithms. The available algorithms are the same as for the
  protocol_compression_algorithms system variable. The default value is
  uncompressed.

  The value of MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS applies only if the
  slave_compressed_protocol system variable is disabled. If
  slave_compressed_protocol is enabled, it takes precedence over
  MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS and connections to the master use zlib
  compression if both master and slave support that algorithm.

o MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL is the compression level to use for
  connections that use the zstd compression algorithm. The permitted
  levels are from 1 to 22, with larger values indicating increasing
  levels of compression. The default zstd compression level is 3. The
  compression level setting has no effect on connections that do not
  use zstd compression.

For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-compression-control.
html.

The MASTER_SSL_xxx options and the MASTER_TLS_VERSION option specify
how the slave uses encryption and ciphers to secure the replication
connection. These options can be changed even on slaves that are
compiled without SSL support. They are saved to the master info
repository, but are ignored if the slave does not have SSL support
enabled. The MASTER_SSL_xxx and MASTER_TLS_VERSION options perform the
same functions as the --ssl-xxx and --tls-version client options
described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-options.html#encrypt
ed-connection-options. The correspondence between the two sets of
options, and the use of the MASTER_SSL_xxx and MASTER_TLS_VERSION
options to set up a secure connection, is explained in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-encrypted
-connections.html.

*Important*:

To connect to the replication master using a user account that
authenticates with the caching_sha2_password plugin, you must either
set up a secure connection as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-encrypted
-connections.html, or enable the unencrypted connection to support
password exchange using an RSA key pair. The caching_sha2_password
authentication plugin is the default for new users created from MySQL
8.0 (for details, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authenti
cation.html). If the user account that you create or use for
replication (as specified by the MASTER_USER option) uses this
authentication plugin, and you are not using a secure connection, you
must enable RSA key pair-based password exchange for a successful
connection.

To enable RSA key pair-based password exchange, specify either the
MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH or the GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY=1 option. Either of
these options provides the RSA public key to the slave:

o MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH indicates the path name to a file containing a
  slave-side copy of the public key required by the master for RSA key
  pair-based password exchange. The file must be in PEM format. This
  option applies to slaves that authenticate with the sha256_password
  or caching_sha2_password authentication plugin. (For sha256_password,
  MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH can be used only if MySQL was built using
  OpenSSL.)

o GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY indicates whether to request from the master
  the public key required for RSA key pair-based password exchange.
  This option applies to slaves that authenticate with the
  caching_sha2_password authentication plugin. For connections by
  accounts that authenticate using this plugin, the master does not
  send the public key unless requested, so it must be requested or
  specified in the client. If MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH is given and
  specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over
  GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY.

The MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD, MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY, and
MASTER_RETRY_COUNT options control how the slave recognizes that the
connection to the master has been lost and makes attempts to reconnect.

o The slave_net_timeout system variable specifies the number of seconds
  that the slave waits for either more data or a heartbeat signal from
  the master, before the slave considers the connection broken, aborts
  the read, and tries to reconnect. The default value is 60 seconds
  (one minute).

o The heartbeat interval, which stops the connection timeout occurring
  in the absence of data if the connection is still good, is controlled
  by the MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD option. A heartbeat signal is sent to
  the slave after that number of seconds, and the waiting period is
  reset whenever the master's binary log is updated with an event.
  Heartbeats are therefore sent by the master only if there are no
  unsent events in the binary log file for a period longer than this.
  The heartbeat interval interval is a decimal value having the range 0
  to 4294967 seconds and a resolution in milliseconds; the smallest
  nonzero value is 0.001. Setting interval to 0 disables heartbeats
  altogether. The heartbeat interval defaults to half the value of the
  slave_net_timeout system variable. It is recorded in the master info
  log and shown in the replication_connection_configuration Performance
  Schema table. Issuing RESET SLAVE resets the heartbeat interval to
  the default value.

  Note that a change to the value or default setting of
  slave_net_timeout does not automatically change the heartbeat
  interval, whether that has been set explicitly or is using a
  previously calculated default. A warning is issued if you set
  @@GLOBAL.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the current
  heartbeat interval. If slave_net_timeout is changed, you must also
  issue CHANGE MASTER TO to adjust the heartbeat interval to an
  appropriate value so that the heartbeat signal occurs before the
  connection timeout. If you do not do this, the heartbeat signal has
  no effect, and if no data is received from the master, the slave can
  make repeated reconnection attempts, creating zombie dump threads.

o If the slave does need to reconnect, the first retry occurs
  immediately after the timeout. MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies the
  interval between reconnection attempts, and MASTER_RETRY_COUNT limits
  the number of reconnection attempts. If both the default settings are
  used, the slave waits 60 seconds between reconnection attempts
  (MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=60), and keeps attempting to reconnect at this
  rate for 60 days (MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=86400). These values are
  recorded in the master info log and shown in the
  replication_connection_configuration Performance Schema table.
  MASTER_RETRY_COUNT supersedes the --master-retry-count server startup
  option.

MASTER_DELAY specifies how many seconds behind the master the slave
must lag. An event received from the master is not executed until at
least interval seconds later than its execution on the master. The
default is 0. An error occurs if interval is not a nonnegative integer
in the range from 0 to 231−1. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-delayed.html.

A CHANGE MASTER TO statement employing the MASTER_DELAY option can be
executed on a running slave when the slave SQL thread is stopped.

MASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network
interfaces, and determines which of the slave's network interfaces is
chosen for connecting to the master.

The address configured with this option, if any, can be seen in the
Master_Bind column of the output from SHOW SLAVE STATUS. In the master
info repository table mysql.slave_master_info, the value can be seen as
the Master_bind column.

The ability to bind a replication slave to a specific network interface
is also supported by NDB Cluster.

MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the
slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the
thread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at
which the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the
next time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE
or MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.
If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS, you also
cannot specify MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 (described later in this
section). If neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified,
the slave uses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before
CHANGE MASTER TO was issued. This ensures that there is no
discontinuity in replication, even if the slave SQL thread was late
compared to the slave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say,
the password to use.

RELAY_LOG_FILE can use either an absolute or relative path, and uses
the same base name as MASTER_LOG_FILE. A CHANGE MASTER TO statement
employing RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, or both options can be
executed on a running slave when the slave SQL thread is stopped. Relay
logs are preserved if at least one of the slave SQL thread and the
slave I/O thread is running. If both threads are stopped, all relay log
files are deleted unless at least one of RELAY_LOG_FILE or
RELAY_LOG_POS is specified. Note that the Group Replication applier
channel (group_replication_applier) has no I/O thread, only a SQL
thread. For this channel, the relay logs are not preserved when the SQL
thread is stopped.

When MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 is used with CHANGE MASTER TO, the slave
attempts to connect to the master using the GTID-based replication
protocol. This option can be used with CHANGE MASTER TO only if both
the slave SQL and slave I/O threads are stopped. Both the slave and the
master must have GTIDs enabled (GTID_MODE=ON, ON_PERMISSIVE, or
OFF_PERMISSIVE on the slave, and GTID_MODE=ON on the master).
Auto-positioning is used for the connection, so the coordinates
represented by MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are not used, and the
use of either or both of these options together with
MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 causes an error. If multi-source replication
is enabled on the slave, you need to set the MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1
option for each applicable replication channel.

With MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 set, in the initial connection handshake,
the slave sends a GTID set containing the transactions that it has
already received, committed, or both. The master responds by sending
all transactions recorded in its binary log whose GTID is not included
in the GTID set sent by the slave. This exchange ensures that the
master only sends the transactions with a GTID that the slave has not
already recorded or committed. If the slave receives transactions from
more than one master, as in the case of a diamond topology, the
auto-skip function ensures that the transactions are not applied twice.
For details of how the GTID set sent by the slave is computed, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids-auto-position
ing.html.

If any of the transactions that should be sent by the master have been
purged from the master's binary log, or added to the set of GTIDs in
the gtid_purged system variable by another method, the master sends the
error ER_MASTER_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS to the slave, and replication
does not start. The GTIDs of the missing purged transactions are
identified and listed in the master's error log in the warning message
ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS. Also, if during the exchange of transactions it
is found that the slave has recorded or committed transactions with the
master's UUID in the GTID, but the master itself has not committed
them, the master sends the error ER_SLAVE_HAS_MORE_GTIDS_THAN_MASTER to
the slave and replication does not start. For information on how to
handle these situations, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids-auto-position
ing.html.

You can see whether replication is running with auto-positioning
enabled by checking the Performance Schema
replication_connection_status table or the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS.
Disabling the MASTER_AUTO_POSITION option again makes the slave revert
to file-based replication, in which case you must also specify one or
both of the MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS options.

IGNORE_SERVER_IDS takes a comma-separated list of 0 or more server IDs.
Events originating from the corresponding servers are ignored, with the
exception of log rotation and deletion events, which are still recorded
in the relay log.

In circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the
terminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than
once. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of
the servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a circular
replication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and
server 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting replication from
server 2 to server 4, you can include IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the
CHANGE MASTER TO statement that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use
server 2 as its master instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to
ignore and not to propagate any statements that originated with the
server that is no longer in use.

If IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server's own ID and the server was
started with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error
results.

*Note*:

When global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) are used for replication,
transactions that have already been applied are automatically ignored,
so the IGNORE_SERVER_IDS function is not required and is deprecated. If
gtid_mode=ON is set for the server, a deprecation warning is issued if
you include the IGNORE_SERVER_IDS option in a CHANGE MASTER TO
statement.

The master info repository and the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS provide
the list of servers that are currently ignored. For more information,
see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/slave-logs-status.html, and
[HELP SHOW SLAVE STATUS].

If a CHANGE MASTER TO statement is issued without any IGNORE_SERVER_IDS
option, any existing list is preserved. To clear the list of ignored
servers, it is necessary to use the option with an empty list:

CHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();

RESET SLAVE ALL clears IGNORE_SERVER_IDS.

*Note*:

A deprecation warning is issued if SET GTID_MODE=ON is issued when any
channel has existing server IDs set with IGNORE_SERVER_IDS. Before
starting GTID-based replication, check for and clear all ignored server
ID lists on the servers involved. The SHOW_SLAVE_STATUS statement
displays the list of ignored IDs, if there is one. If you do receive
the deprecation warning, you can still clear a list after gtid_mode=ON
is set by issuing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement containing the
IGNORE_SERVER_IDS option with an empty list.

Invoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the previous values for MASTER_HOST,
MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and MASTER_LOG_POS to be written to the
error log, along with other information about the slave's state prior
to execution.

CHANGE MASTER TO causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction.
See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

From MySQL 5.7, the strict requirement to execute STOP SLAVE prior to
issuing any CHANGE MASTER TO statement (and START SLAVE afterward) is
removed. Instead of depending on whether the slave is stopped, the
behavior of CHANGE MASTER TO depends on the states of the slave SQL
thread and slave I/O threads; which of these threads is stopped or
running now determines the options that can or cannot be used with a
CHANGE MASTER TO statement at a given point in time. The rules for
making this determination are listed here:

o If the SQL thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using
  any combination that is otherwise allowed of RELAY_LOG_FILE,
  RELAY_LOG_POS, and MASTER_DELAY options, even if the slave I/O thread
  is running. No other options may be used with this statement when the
  I/O thread is running.

o If the I/O thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using
  any of the options for this statement (in any allowed combination)
  except RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, MASTER_DELAY, or
  MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 even when the SQL thread is running.

o Both the SQL thread and the I/O thread must be stopped before issuing
  a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that employs MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1.

You can check the current state of the slave SQL and I/O threads using
SHOW SLAVE STATUS. Note that the Group Replication applier channel
(group_replication_applier) has no I/O thread, only a SQL thread.

For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-switch.ht
ml.

If you are using statement-based replication and temporary tables, it
is possible for a CHANGE MASTER TO statement following a STOP SLAVE
statement to leave behind temporary tables on the slave. A warning
(ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO) is now issued whenever this
occurs. You can avoid this in such cases by making sure that the value
of the Slave_open_temp_tables system status variable is equal to 0
prior to executing such a CHANGE MASTER TO statement.

CHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the
snapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log
coordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading
the snapshot into the slave to synchronize it with the master, you can
run CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos
on the slave to specify the coordinates at which the slave should begin
reading the master binary log.

The following example changes the master server the slave uses and
establishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave
begins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to
replicate the master:

CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='master2.example.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,
  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;

The next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.
It is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to
execute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be
reachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread
(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):

CHANGE MASTER TO
  RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',
  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER sets one or more replication filtering rules
on the slave in the same way as starting the slave mysqld with
replication filtering options such as --replicate-do-db or
--replicate-wild-ignore-table. Unlike the case with the server options,
this statement does not require restarting the server to take effect,
only that the slave SQL thread be stopped using STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD
first (and restarted with START SLAVE SQL_THREAD afterwards). CHANGE
REPLICATION FILTER requires the REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN or SUPER
privilege. Use the FOR CHANNEL channel clause to make a replication
filter specific to a replication channel, for example on a multi-source
replication slave. Filters applied without a specific FOR CHANNEL
clause are considered global filters, meaning that they are applied to
all replication channels.

Global replication filters cannot be set on a MySQL server instance
that is configured for Group Replication, because filtering
transactions on some servers would make the group unable to reach
agreement on a consistent state. Channel specific replication filters
can be set on replication channels that are not directly involved with
Group Replication, such as where a group member also acts as a
replication slave to a master that is outside the group. They cannot be
set on the group_replication_applier or group_replication_recovery
channels.

The following list shows the CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER options and how
they relate to --replicate-* server options:

o REPLICATE_DO_DB: Include updates based on database name. Equivalent
  to --replicate-do-db.

o REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB: Exclude updates based on database name.
  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-db.

o REPLICATE_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on table name. Equivalent
  to --replicate-do-table.

o REPLICATE_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on table name.
  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-table.

o REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on wildcard pattern
  matching table name. Equivalent to --replicate-wild-do-table.

o REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on wildcard
  pattern matching table name. Equivalent to
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table.

o REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB: Perform updates on slave after substituting new
  name on slave for specified database on master. Equivalent to
  --replicate-rewrite-db.

The precise effects of REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB filters
are dependent on whether statement-based or row-based replication is in
effect. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules.html, for
more information.

Multiple replication filtering rules can be created in a single CHANGE
REPLICATION FILTER statement by separating the rules with commas, as
shown here:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (d2);

Issuing the statement just shown is equivalent to starting the slave
mysqld with the options --replicate-do-db=d1 --replicate-ignore-db=d2.

On a multi-source replication slave, which uses multiple replication
channels to process transaction from different sources, use the FOR
CHANNEL channel clause to set a replication filter on a replication
channel:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1) FOR CHANNEL channel_1;

This enables you to create a channel specific replication filter to
filter out selected data from a source. When a FOR CHANNEL clause is
provided, the replication filter statement acts on that slave
replication channel removing any existing replication filter which has
the same filter type as the specified replication filters, and
replacing them with the specified filter. Filter types not explicitly
listed in the statement are not modified. If issued against a slave
replication channel which is not configured, the statement fails with
an ER_SLAVE_CONFIGURATION error. If issued against Group Replication
channels, the statement fails with an
ER_SLAVE_CHANNEL_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED error.

On a replication slave with multiple replication channels configured,
issuing CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER with no FOR CHANNEL clause configures
the replication filter for every configured slave replication channel,
and for the global replication filters. For every filter type, if the
filter type is listed in the statement, then any existing filter rules
of that type are replaced by the filter rules specified in the most
recently issued statement, otherwise the old value of the filter type
is retained. For more information see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules-channel-based
-filters.html.

If the same filtering rule is specified multiple times, only the last
such rule is actually used. For example, the two statements shown here
have exactly the same effect, because the first REPLICATE_DO_DB rule in
the first statement is ignored:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db1, db2), REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);

*Caution*:

This behavior differs from that of the --replicate-* filter options
where specifying the same option multiple times causes the creation of
multiple filter rules.

Names of tables and database not containing any special characters need
not be quoted. Values used with REPLICATION_WILD_TABLE and
REPLICATION_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE are string expressions, possibly
containing (special) wildcard characters, and so must be quoted. This
is shown in the following example statements:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = ('db1.old%');

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE = ('db1.new%', 'db2.new%');

Values used with REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB represent pairs of database
names; each such value must be enclosed in parentheses. The following
statement rewrites statements occurring on database db1 on the master
to database db2 on the slave:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((db1, db2));

The statement just shown contains two sets of parentheses, one
enclosing the pair of database names, and the other enclosing the
entire list. This is perhaps more easily seen in the following example,
which creates two rewrite-db rules, one rewriting database dbA to dbB,
and one rewriting database dbC to dbD:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
  REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((dbA, dbB), (dbC, dbD));

The CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER statement replaces replication filtering
rules only for the filter types and replication channels affected by
the statement, and leaves other rules and channels unchanged. If you
want to unset all filters of a given type, set the filter's value to an
explicitly empty list, as shown in this example, which removes all
existing REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB rules:

CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER
    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = ();

Setting a filter to empty in this way removes all existing rules, does
not create any new ones, and does not restore any rules set at mysqld
startup using --replicate-* options on the command line or in the
configuration file.

The RESET SLAVE ALL statement removes channel specific replication
filters that were set on channels deleted by the statement. When the
deleted channel or channels are recreated, any global replication
filters specified for the slave are copied to them, and no channel
specific replication filters are applied.

571,RESET SLAVE,35,"Syntax:
RESET SLAVE [ALL] [channel_option]

channel_option:
    FOR CHANNEL channel

RESET SLAVE makes the slave forget its replication position in the
master's binary log. This statement is meant to be used for a clean
start: It clears the master info and relay log info repositories,
deletes all the relay log files, and starts a new relay log file. It
also resets to 0 the replication delay specified with the MASTER_DELAY
option to CHANGE MASTER TO.

*Note*:

All relay log files are deleted, even if they have not been completely
executed by the slave SQL thread. (This is a condition likely to exist
on a replication slave if you have issued a STOP SLAVE statement or if
the slave is highly loaded.)

For a server where GTIDs are in use (gtid_mode is ON), issuing RESET
SLAVE has no effect on the GTID execution history. The statement does
not change the values of gtid_executed or gtid_purged, or the
mysql.gtid_executed table. If you need to reset the GTID execution
history, use RESET MASTER, even if the GTID-enabled server is a
replication slave where binary logging is disabled.

RESET SLAVE requires the RELOAD privilege.

To use RESET SLAVE, the slave replication threads must be stopped, so
on a running slave use STOP SLAVE before issuing RESET SLAVE. To use
RESET SLAVE on a Group Replication group member, the member status must
be OFFLINE, meaning that the plugin is loaded but the member does not
currently belong to any group. A group member can be taken offline by
using a STOP GROUP REPLICATION statement.

The optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which
replication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL
channel clause applies the RESET SLAVE statement to a specific
replication channel. Combining a FOR CHANNEL channel clause with the
ALL option deletes the specified channel. If no channel is named and no
extra channels exist, the statement applies to the default channel.
Issuing a RESET SLAVE ALL statement without a FOR CHANNEL channel
clause when multiple replication channels exist deletes all replication
channels and recreates only the default channel. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-channels.html for
more information.

RESET SLAVE does not change any replication connection parameters such
as the master host, master port, master user, or master password. RESET
SLAVE also does not affect the PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER account. If you
want to reset the connection parameters intentionally, you need to use
RESET SLAVE ALL, which clears the connection parameters, including the
MASTER_USER and PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER accounts. RESET SLAVE ALL also
clears the IGNORE_SERVER_IDS list set by CHANGE MASTER TO. When you
have used RESET SLAVE ALL, you must issue a CHANGE MASTER TO statement
after the server start to specify new connection parameters.

In the event of a server crash or deliberate restart after issuing
RESET SLAVE but before issuing START SLAVE, retention of the
replication connection parameters depends on the repository used for
the master info log:

o From MySQL 8.0.13, when master_info_repository=TABLE is set on the
  server (which is the default from MySQL 8.0), replication connection
  parameters are preserved in the crash-safe InnoDB table
  mysql.slave_master_info as part of the RESET SLAVE operation. They
  are also retained in memory. In the event of a server crash or
  deliberate restart after issuing RESET SLAVE but before issuing START
  SLAVE, the replication connection parameters are retrieved from the
  table and reused for the new connection.

o When master_info_repository=FILE is set on the server, replication
  connection parameters are only retained in memory. If the slave
  mysqld is restarted immediately after issuing RESET SLAVE due to a
  server crash or deliberate restart, the connection parameters are
  lost. In that case, you must issue a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after
  the server start to respecify the connection parameters before
  issuing START SLAVE.

RESET SLAVE does not change any replication filter settings (such as
--replicate-ignore-table) for channels affected by the statement.
However, RESET SLAVE ALL removes the replication filters that were set
on the channels deleted by the statement. When the deleted channel or
channels are recreated, any global replication filters specified for
the slave are copied to them, and no channel specific replication
filters are applied. For more information see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules-channel-based
-filters.html.

RESET SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

If the slave SQL thread was in the middle of replicating temporary
tables when it was stopped, and RESET SLAVE is issued, these replicated
temporary tables are deleted on the slave.

RESET SLAVE does not reset the heartbeat period
(Slave_heartbeat_period) or SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT.

*Note*:

When used on an NDB Cluster replication slave SQL node, RESET SLAVE
clears the mysql.ndb_apply_status table. You should keep in mind when
using this statement that ndb_apply_status uses the NDB storage engine
and so is shared by all SQL nodes attached to the slave cluster.

You can override this behavior by issuing SET GLOBAL
@@ndb_clear_apply_status=OFF prior to executing RESET SLAVE, which
keeps the slave from purging the ndb_apply_status table in such cases.

START SLAVE with no thread_type options starts both of the slave
threads. The I/O thread reads events from the master server and stores
them in the relay log. The SQL thread reads events from the relay log
and executes them. START SLAVE requires the REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN or
SUPER privilege.

If START SLAVE succeeds in starting the slave threads, it returns
without any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the
slave threads start and then later stop (for example, because they do
not manage to connect to the master or read its binary log, or some
other problem). START SLAVE does not warn you about this. You must
check the slave's error log for error messages generated by the slave
threads, or check that they are running satisfactorily with SHOW SLAVE
STATUS.

START SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

gtid_next must be set to AUTOMATIC before issuing this statement.

The optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which
replication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL
channel clause applies the START SLAVE statement to a specific
replication channel. If no clause is named and no extra channels exist,
the statement applies to the default channel. If a START SLAVE
statement does not have a channel defined when using multiple channels,
this statement starts the specified threads for all channels. This
statement is disallowed for the group_replication_recovery channel. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-channels.html for
more information.

You can add IO_THREAD and SQL_THREAD options to the statement to name
which of the threads to start. Note that the Group Replication applier
channel (group_replication_applier) has no I/O thread, only a SQL
thread. Specifying the IO_THREAD or SQL_THREAD options when you start
this channel has no benefit.

MySQL supports pluggable user-password authentication with START SLAVE
with the USER, PASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH and PLUGIN_DIR options, as
described in the following list:

o USER: User name. Cannot be set to an empty or null string, or left
  unset if PASSWORD is used.

o PASSWORD: Password.

o DEFAULT_AUTH: Name of plugin; default is MySQL native authentication.

o PLUGIN_DIR: Location of plugin.

You cannot use the SQL_THREAD option when specifying any of USER,
PASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH, or PLUGIN_DIR, unless the IO_THREAD option is
also provided.

See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/pluggable-authentication.html,
for more information.

If an insecure connection is used with any these options, the server
issues the warning Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is
extremely insecure.

START SLAVE ... UNTIL supports two additional options for use with
global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids.html). Each
of these takes a set of one or more global transaction identifiers
gtid_set as an argument (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids-concepts.html
#replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets, for more information).

When no thread_type is specified, START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS
causes the slave SQL thread to process transactions until it has
reached the first transaction whose GTID is listed in the gtid_set.
START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads to process
all transactions until the last transaction in the gtid_set has been
processed by both threads. In other words, START SLAVE UNTIL
SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS causes the slave SQL thread to process all
transactions occurring before the first GTID in the gtid_set is
reached, and START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads
to handle all transactions, including those whose GTIDs are found in
gtid_set, until each has encountered a transaction whose GTID is not
part of the set. SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS and SQL_AFTER_GTIDS each support the
SQL_THREAD and IO_THREAD options, although using IO_THREAD with them
currently has no effect.

For example, START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS =
3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56 causes the slave SQL thread
to process all transactions originating from the master whose
server_uuid is 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 until it encounters
the transaction having sequence number 11; it then stops without
processing this transaction. In other words, all transactions up to and
including the transaction with sequence number 10 are processed.
Executing START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS =
3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56, on the other hand, would
cause the slave SQL thread to obtain all transactions just mentioned
from the master, including all of the transactions having the sequence
numbers 11 through 56, and then to stop without processing any
additional transactions; that is, the transaction having sequence
number 56 would be the last transaction fetched by the slave SQL
thread.

When using a multithreaded slave with slave_preserve_commit_order=0
set, there is a chance of gaps in the sequence of transactions that
have been executed from the relay log in the following cases:

o killing the coordinator thread

o after an error occurs in the applier threads

o mysqld shuts down unexpectedly

Use the START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS statement to cause a
multithreaded slave's worker threads to only run until no more gaps are
found in the relay log, and then to stop. This statement can take an
SQL_THREAD option, but the effects of the statement remain unchanged.
It has no effect on the slave I/O thread (and cannot be used with the
IO_THREAD option).

Issuing START SLAVE on a multithreaded slave with gaps in the sequence
of transactions executed from the relay log generates a warning. In
such a situation, the solution is to use START SLAVE UNTIL
SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS, then issue RESET SLAVE to remove any remaining
relay logs. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-features-transactio
n-inconsistencies.html for more information.

To change a failed multithreaded slave to single-threaded mode, you can
issue the following series of statements, in the order shown:

START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS;

SET @@GLOBAL.slave_parallel_workers = 0;

START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;

*Note*:

It is possible to view the entire text of a running START SLAVE ...
statement, including any USER or PASSWORD values used, in the output of
SHOW PROCESSLIST. This is also true for the text of a running CHANGE
MASTER TO statement, including any values it employs for MASTER_USER or
MASTER_PASSWORD.

STOP SLAVE [thread_types] [channel_option]

thread_type: IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD

channel_option:

Stops the slave threads. STOP SLAVE requires the
REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN or SUPER privilege. Recommended best practice
is to execute STOP SLAVE on the slave before stopping the slave server
(see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-shutdown.html, for
more information).

When using the row-based logging format: You should execute STOP SLAVE
or STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD on the slave prior to shutting down the slave
server if you are replicating any tables that use a nontransactional
storage engine (see the Note later in this section).

Like START SLAVE, this statement may be used with the IO_THREAD and
SQL_THREAD options to name the thread or threads to be stopped. Note
that the Group Replication applier channel (group_replication_applier)
has no I/O thread, only a SQL thread. Using the SQL_THREAD option
therefore stops this channel completely.

STOP SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

gtid_next must be set to AUTOMATIC before issuing this statement.

You can control how long STOP SLAVE waits before timing out by setting
the rpl_stop_slave_timeout system variable. This can be used to avoid
deadlocks between STOP SLAVE and other slave SQL statements using
different client connections to the slave. When the timeout value is
reached, the issuing client returns an error message and stops waiting,
but the STOP SLAVE instruction remains in effect. Once the slave
threads are no longer busy, the STOP SLAVE statement is executed and
the slave stops.

Some CHANGE MASTER TO statements are allowed while the slave is
running, depending on the states of the slave SQL and I/O threads.
However, using STOP SLAVE prior to executing CHANGE MASTER TO in such
cases is still supported. See [HELP CHANGE MASTER TO], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-switch.ht
ml, for more information.

The optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which
replication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL
channel clause applies the STOP SLAVE statement to a specific
replication channel. If no channel is named and no extra channels
exist, the statement applies to the default channel. If a STOP SLAVE
statement does not name a channel when using multiple channels, this
statement stops the specified threads for all channels. This statement
cannot be used with the group_replication_recovery channel. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-channels.html for
more information.

When using statement-based replication: changing the master while it
has open temporary tables is potentially unsafe. This is one of the
reasons why statement-based replication of temporary tables is not
recommended. You can find out whether there are any temporary tables on
the slave by checking the value of Slave_open_temp_tables; when using
statement-based replication, this value should be 0 before executing
CHANGE MASTER TO. If there are any temporary tables open on the slave,
issuing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after issuing a STOP SLAVE causes
an ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO warning.

When using a multithreaded slave (slave_parallel_workers is a nonzero
value), any gaps in the sequence of transactions executed from the
relay log are closed as part of stopping the worker threads. If the
slave is stopped unexpectedly (for example due to an error in a worker
thread, or another thread issuing KILL) while a STOP SLAVE statement is
executing, the sequence of executed transactions from the relay log may
become inconsistent. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-features-transactio
n-inconsistencies.html for more information.

If the current replication event group has modified one or more
nontransactional tables, STOP SLAVE waits for up to 60 seconds for the
event group to complete, unless you issue a KILL QUERY or KILL
CONNECTION statement for the slave SQL thread. If the event group
remains incomplete after the timeout, an error message is logged.

575,PREPARE,35,"Syntax:
PREPARE stmt_name FROM preparable_stmt

The PREPARE statement prepares a SQL statement and assigns it a name,
stmt_name, by which to refer to the statement later. The prepared
statement is executed with EXECUTE and released with DEALLOCATE
PREPARE. For examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-prepared-statements.html.

Statement names are not case-sensitive. preparable_stmt is either a
string literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL
statement. The text must represent a single statement, not multiple
statements. Within the statement, ? characters can be used as parameter
markers to indicate where data values are to be bound to the query
later when you execute it. The ? characters should not be enclosed
within quotation marks, even if you intend to bind them to string
values. Parameter markers can be used only where data values should
appear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers, and so forth.

If a prepared statement with the given name already exists, it is
deallocated implicitly before the new statement is prepared. This means
that if the new statement contains an error and cannot be prepared, an
error is returned and no statement with the given name exists.

The scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it is
created, which as several implications:

o A prepared statement created in one session is not available to other
  sessions.

o When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its prepared
  statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the client
  is not notified that the connection was lost. For this reason,
  clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html.

o A prepared statement created within a stored program continues to
  exist after the program finishes executing and can be executed
  outside the program later.

o A statement prepared in stored program context cannot refer to stored
  procedure or function parameters or local variables because they go
  out of scope when the program ends and would be unavailable were the
  statement to be executed later outside the program. As a workaround,
  refer instead to user-defined variables, which also have session
  scope; see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/user-variables.html.

576,EXECUTE STATEMENT,35,"Syntax:
EXECUTE stmt_name
    [USING @var_name [, @var_name] ...]

After preparing a statement with PREPARE, you execute it with an
EXECUTE statement that refers to the prepared statement name. If the
prepared statement contains any parameter markers, you must supply a
USING clause that lists user variables containing the values to be
bound to the parameters. Parameter values can be supplied only by user
variables, and the USING clause must name exactly as many variables as
the number of parameter markers in the statement.

You can execute a given prepared statement multiple times, passing
different variables to it or setting the variables to different values
before each execution.

results in an error. If too many prepared statements are created and
not deallocated by either the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement or the end

579,BEGIN END,36,"Syntax:
[begin_label:] BEGIN
    [statement_list]
END [end_label]

BEGIN ... END syntax is used for writing compound statements, which can
appear within stored programs (stored procedures and functions,
triggers, and events). A compound statement can contain multiple
statements, enclosed by the BEGIN and END keywords. statement_list
represents a list of one or more statements, each terminated by a
semicolon (;) statement delimiter. The statement_list itself is
optional, so the empty compound statement (BEGIN END) is legal.

BEGIN ... END blocks can be nested.

Use of multiple statements requires that a client is able to send
statement strings containing the ; statement delimiter. In the mysql
command-line client, this is handled with the delimiter command.
Changing the ; end-of-statement delimiter (for example, to //) permit ;
to be used in a program body. For an example, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-programs-defining.html.

A BEGIN ... END block can be labeled. See [HELP labels].

[begin_label:] REPEAT

UNTIL search_condition
END REPEAT [end_label]

[begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
    statement_list
END WHILE [end_label]

Labels are permitted for BEGIN ... END blocks and for the LOOP, REPEAT,
and WHILE statements. Label use for those statements follows these
rules:

o begin_label must be followed by a colon.

o begin_label can be given without end_label. If end_label is present,
  it must be the same as begin_label.

o end_label cannot be given without begin_label.

o Labels at the same nesting level must be distinct.

o Labels can be up to 16 characters long.

To refer to a label within the labeled construct, use an ITERATE or
LEAVE statement. The following example uses those statements to
continue iterating or terminate the loop:

CREATE PROCEDURE doiterate(p1 INT)
BEGIN
  label1: LOOP
    SET p1 = p1 + 1;
    IF p1 < 10 THEN ITERATE label1; END IF;
    LEAVE label1;

declared within the block. For details, see [HELP DECLARE HANDLER].

581,DECLARE VARIABLE,36,"Syntax:
DECLARE var_name [, var_name] ... type [DEFAULT value]

This statement declares local variables within stored programs. To
provide a default value for a variable, include a DEFAULT clause. The
value can be specified as an expression; it need not be a constant. If
the DEFAULT clause is missing, the initial value is NULL.

Local variables are treated like stored routine parameters with respect
to data type and overflow checking. See [HELP CREATE PROCEDURE].

Variable declarations must appear before cursor or handler
declarations.

Local variable names are not case-sensitive. Permissible characters and
quoting rules are the same as for other identifiers, as described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html.

The scope of a local variable is the BEGIN ... END block within which
it is declared. The variable can be referred to in blocks nested within
the declaring block, except those blocks that declare a variable with
the same name.

For examples of variable declarations, see

Or:

CASE
    WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list
    [WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE

The CASE statement for stored programs implements a complex conditional
construct.

*Note*:

There is also a CASE expr, which differs from the CASE statement
described here. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/control-flow-functions.html.
The CASE statement cannot have an ELSE NULL clause, and it is
terminated with END CASE instead of END.

For the first syntax, case_value is an expression. This value is
compared to the when_value expression in each WHEN clause until one of
them is equal. When an equal when_value is found, the corresponding
THEN clause statement_list executes. If no when_value is equal, the
ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one.

This syntax cannot be used to test for equality with NULL because NULL
= NULL is false. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/working-with-null.html.

For the second syntax, each WHEN clause search_condition expression is
evaluated until one is true, at which point its corresponding THEN
clause statement_list executes. If no search_condition is equal, the
ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one.

If no when_value or search_condition matches the value tested and the
CASE statement contains no ELSE clause, a Case not found for CASE
statement error results.

Each statement_list consists of one or more SQL statements; an empty
statement_list is not permitted.

To handle situations where no value is matched by any WHEN clause, use
an ELSE containing an empty BEGIN ... END block, as shown in this
example. (The indentation used here in the ELSE clause is for purposes
of clarity only, and is not otherwise significant.)

variables specified in the FETCH statement.

The SELECT statement cannot have an INTO clause.

Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations and after

A stored program may contain multiple cursor declarations, but each
cursor declared in a given block must have a unique name. For an

specified statement executes. statement can be a simple statement such
as SET var_name = value, or a compound statement written using BEGIN
and END (see [HELP BEGIN END]).

Handler declarations must appear after variable or condition
declarations.

The handler_action value indicates what action the handler takes after
execution of the handler statement:

o CONTINUE: Execution of the current program continues.

o EXIT: Execution terminates for the BEGIN ... END compound statement
  in which the handler is declared. This is true even if the condition
  occurs in an inner block.

o UNDO: Not supported.

The condition_value for DECLARE ... HANDLER indicates the specific
condition or class of conditions that activates the handler. It can
take the following forms:

o mysql_error_code: An integer literal indicating a MySQL error code,
  such as 1051 to specify ""unknown table"":

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR 1051
  BEGIN
    -- body of handler
  END;

  Do not use MySQL error code 0 because that indicates success rather
  than an error condition. For a list of MySQL error codes, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html.

o SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value: A 5-character string literal
  indicating an SQLSTATE value, such as '42S01' to specify ""unknown
  table"":

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
  BEGIN
    -- body of handler

  Do not use SQLSTATE values that begin with '00' because those
  indicate success rather than an error condition. For a list of
  SQLSTATE values, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html.

o condition_name: A condition name previously specified with DECLARE
  ... CONDITION. A condition name can be associated with a MySQL error
  code or SQLSTATE value. See [HELP DECLARE CONDITION].

o SQLWARNING: Shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values that begin
  with '01'.

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING
  BEGIN
    -- body of handler
  END;

o NOT FOUND: Shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values that begin with
  '02'. This is relevant within the context of cursors and is used to
  control what happens when a cursor reaches the end of a data set. If
  no more rows are available, a No Data condition occurs with SQLSTATE
  value '02000'. To detect this condition, you can set up a handler for
  it or for a NOT FOUND condition.

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND
  BEGIN
    -- body of handler
  END;

  For another example, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/cursors.html. The NOT FOUND
  condition also occurs for SELECT ... INTO var_list statements that
  retrieve no rows.

o SQLEXCEPTION: Shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values that do not
  begin with '00', '01', or '02'.

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
  BEGIN
    -- body of handler
  END;

For information about how the server chooses handlers when a condition
occurs, see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/handler-scope.html.

If a condition occurs for which no handler has been declared, the
action taken depends on the condition class:

o For SQLEXCEPTION conditions, the stored program terminates at the
  statement that raised the condition, as if there were an EXIT
  handler. If the program was called by another stored program, the
  calling program handles the condition using the handler selection
  rules applied to its own handlers.

o For SQLWARNING conditions, the program continues executing, as if
  there were a CONTINUE handler.

o For NOT FOUND conditions, if the condition was raised normally, the
  action is CONTINUE. If it was raised by SIGNAL or RESIGNAL, the
  action is EXIT.

This extension applies only to the current diagnostics area. It does
not apply to the second diagnostics area because GET STACKED
DIAGNOSTICS is permitted only if the current context is a condition
handler. If that is not the case, a GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS when
handler not active error occurs.

For a description of the diagnostics area, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/diagnostics-area.html. Briefly,
it contains two kinds of information:

o Statement information, such as the number of conditions that occurred
  or the affected-rows count.

o Condition information, such as the error code and message. If a
  statement raises multiple conditions, this part of the diagnostics
  area has a condition area for each one. If a statement raises no
  conditions, this part of the diagnostics area is empty.

For a statement that produces three conditions, the diagnostics area
contains statement and condition information like this:

Statement information:
  row count
  ... other statement information items ...
Condition area list:
  Condition area 1:
    error code for condition 1
    error message for condition 1
    ... other condition information items ...
  Condition area 2:
    error code for condition 2:
    error message for condition 2
    ... other condition information items ...
  Condition area 3:
    error code for condition 3
    error message for condition 3
    ... other condition information items ...

GET DIAGNOSTICS can obtain either statement or condition information,
but not both in the same statement:

o To obtain statement information, retrieve the desired statement items
  into target variables. This instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the
  number of available conditions and the rows-affected count to the
  user variables @p1 and @p2:

GET DIAGNOSTICS @p1 = NUMBER, @p2 = ROW_COUNT;

o To obtain condition information, specify the condition number and
  retrieve the desired condition items into target variables. This
  instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the SQLSTATE value and error
  message to the user variables @p3 and @p4:

GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1
  @p3 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p4 = MESSAGE_TEXT;

The retrieval list specifies one or more target = item_name
assignments, separated by commas. Each assignment names a target
variable and either a statement_information_item_name or
condition_information_item_name designator, depending on whether the
statement retrieves statement or condition information.

Valid target designators for storing item information can be stored
procedure or function parameters, stored program local variables
declared with DECLARE, or user-defined variables.

Valid condition_number designators can be stored procedure or function
parameters, stored program local variables declared with DECLARE,
user-defined variables, system variables, or literals. A character
literal may include a _charset introducer. A warning occurs if the
condition number is not in the range from 1 to the number of condition
areas that have information. In this case, the warning is added to the
diagnostics area without clearing it.

When a condition occurs, MySQL does not populate all condition items
recognized by GET DIAGNOSTICS. For example:

mysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1
         @p5 = SCHEMA_NAME, @p6 = TABLE_NAME;
mysql> SELECT @p5, @p6;
+------+------+
| @p5  | @p6  |
+------+------+
|      |      |
+------+------+

In standard SQL, if there are multiple conditions, the first condition
relates to the SQLSTATE value returned for the previous SQL statement.
In MySQL, this is not guaranteed. To get the main error, you cannot do
this:

GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1 @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;

Instead, retrieve the condition count first, then use it to specify
which condition number to inspect:

GET DIAGNOSTICS @cno = NUMBER;
GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION @cno @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;

For information about permissible statement and condition information
items, and which ones are populated when a condition occurs, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/diagnostics-area.html#diagnosti
cs-area-information-items.

Here is an example that uses GET DIAGNOSTICS and an exception handler
in stored procedure context to assess the outcome of an insert
operation. If the insert was successful, the procedure uses GET
DIAGNOSTICS to get the rows-affected count. This shows that you can use
GET DIAGNOSTICS multiple times to retrieve information about a
statement as long as the current diagnostics area has not been cleared.

CREATE PROCEDURE do_insert(value INT)
BEGIN
  -- Declare variables to hold diagnostics area information
  DECLARE code CHAR(5) DEFAULT '00000';
  DECLARE msg TEXT;
  DECLARE rows INT;
  DECLARE result TEXT;
  -- Declare exception handler for failed insert
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
      GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1
        code = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, msg = MESSAGE_TEXT;
    END;

  -- Perform the insert
  INSERT INTO t1 (int_col) VALUES(value);
  -- Check whether the insert was successful
  IF code = '00000' THEN
    GET DIAGNOSTICS rows = ROW_COUNT;
    SET result = CONCAT('insert succeeded, row count = ',rows);
  ELSE
    SET result = CONCAT('insert failed, error = ',code,', message = ',msg);
  END IF;
  -- Say what happened
  SELECT result;
END;

Suppose that t1.int_col is an integer column that is declared as NOT
NULL. The procedure produces these results when invoked to insert
non-NULL and NULL values, respectively:

mysql> CALL do_insert(1);
+---------------------------------+
| result                          |
+---------------------------------+
| insert succeeded, row count = 1 |
+---------------------------------+

mysql> CALL do_insert(NULL);

RESIGNAL passes on the error condition information that is available
during execution of a condition handler within a compound statement
inside a stored procedure or function, trigger, or event. RESIGNAL may
change some or all information before passing it on. RESIGNAL is
related to SIGNAL, but instead of originating a condition as SIGNAL
does, RESIGNAL relays existing condition information, possibly after
modifying it.

RESIGNAL makes it possible to both handle an error and return the error
information. Otherwise, by executing an SQL statement within the
handler, information that caused the handler's activation is destroyed.
RESIGNAL also can make some procedures shorter if a given handler can
handle part of a situation, then pass the condition ""up the line"" to
another handler.

No privileges are required to execute the RESIGNAL statement.

All forms of RESIGNAL require that the current context be a condition
handler. Otherwise, RESIGNAL is illegal and a RESIGNAL when handler not
active error occurs.

To retrieve information from the diagnostics area, use the GET
DIAGNOSTICS statement (see [HELP GET DIAGNOSTICS]). For information

SIGNAL is the way to ""return"" an error. SIGNAL provides error
information to a handler, to an outer portion of the application, or to
the client. Also, it provides control over the error's characteristics
(error number, SQLSTATE value, message). Without SIGNAL, it is
necessary to resort to workarounds such as deliberately referring to a
nonexistent table to cause a routine to return an error.

No privileges are required to execute the SIGNAL statement.

The ALTER USER statement modifies MySQL accounts. It enables
authentication, role, SSL/TLS, resource-limit, and password-management
properties to be modified for existing accounts. It can also be used to
lock and unlock accounts.

In most cases, ALTER USER requires the global CREATE USER privilege, or
the UPDATE privilege for the mysql system schema. The exceptions are:

o Any client who connects to the server using a nonanonymous account
  can change the password for that account. (In particular, you can
  change your own password.) To see which account the server
  authenticated you as, invoke the CURRENT_USER() function:

SELECT CURRENT_USER();

o For DEFAULT ROLE syntax, ALTER USER requires these privileges:

  o Setting the default roles for another user requires the global
    CREATE USER privilege, or the UPDATE privilege for the
    mysql.default_roles system table.

  o Setting the default roles for yourself requires no special
    privileges, as long as the roles you want as the default have been
    granted to you.

o Statements that modify secondary passwords require these privileges:

  o The APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN privilege is required to use the
    RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD or DISCARD OLD PASSWORD clause for ALTER
    USER statements that apply to your own account. The privilege is
    required to manipulate your own secondary password because most
    users require only one password.

  o If an account is to be permitted to manipulate secondary passwords
    for all accounts, it requires the CREATE USER privilege rather than
    APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN.

When the read_only system variable is enabled, ALTER USER additionally
requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

By default, an error occurs if you try to modify a user that does not
exist. If the IF EXISTS clause is given, the statement produces a
warning for each named user that does not exist, rather than an error.

600,CREATE ROLE,37,"Syntax:
CREATE ROLE [IF NOT EXISTS] role [, role ] ...

CREATE ROLE creates one or more roles, which are named collections of
privileges. To use this statement, you must have the global CREATE ROLE
or CREATE USER privilege. When the read_only system variable is
enabled, CREATE ROLE additionally requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN or
SUPER privilege.

A role when created is locked, has no password, and is assigned the
default authentication plugin. (These role attributes can be changed
later with the ALTER USER statement, by users who have the global
CREATE USER privilege.)

CREATE ROLE either succeeds for all named roles or rolls back and has
no effect if any error occurs. By default, an error occurs if you try
to create a role that already exists. If the IF NOT EXISTS clause is
given, the statement produces a warning for each named role that
already exists, rather than an error.

The statement is written to the binary log if it succeeds, but not if
it fails; in that case, rollback occurs and no changes are made. A
statement written to the binary log includes all named roles. If the IF
NOT EXISTS clause is given, this includes even roles that already exist
and were not created.

Each role name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. For example:

CREATE ROLE 'administrator', 'developer';
CREATE ROLE 'webapp'@'localhost';

The host name part of the role name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

The CREATE USER statement creates new MySQL accounts. It enables
authentication, role, SSL/TLS, resource-limit, and password-management
properties to be established for new accounts. It also controls whether
accounts are initially locked or unlocked.

To use CREATE USER, you must have the global CREATE USER privilege, or
the INSERT privilege for the mysql system schema. When the read_only
system variable is enabled, CREATE USER additionally requires the
CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

CREATE USER either succeeds for all named users or rolls back and has
no effect if any error occurs. By default, an error occurs if you try

DROP ROLE removes one or more roles (named collections of privileges).
To use this statement, you must have the global DROP ROLE or CREATE
USER privilege. When the read_only system variable is enabled, DROP
ROLE additionally requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, users who have the CREATE USER privilege can use
this statement to drop accounts that are locked or unlocked. Users who
have the DROP ROLE privilege can use this statement only to drop
accounts that are locked (unlocked accounts are presumably user
accounts used to log in to the server and not just as roles).

Roles named in the mandatory_roles system variable value cannot be
dropped.

DROP ROLE either succeeds for all named roles or rolls back and has no
effect if any error occurs. By default, an error occurs if you try to
drop a role that does not exist. If the IF EXISTS clause is given, the
statement produces a warning for each named role that does not exist,
rather than an error.

The statement is written to the binary log if it succeeds, but not if
it fails; in that case, rollback occurs and no changes are made. A

DROP ROLE 'administrator', 'developer';
DROP ROLE 'webapp'@'localhost';

The host name part of the role name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

A dropped role is automatically revoked from any user account (or role)
to which the role was granted. Within any current session for such an
account, its adjusted privileges apply beginning with the next
statement executed.

}

The GRANT statement enables system administrators to grant privileges
and roles, which can be granted to user accounts and roles. These
syntax restrictions apply:

o GRANT cannot mix granting both privileges and roles in the same
  statement. A given GRANT statement must grant either privileges or
  roles.

o The ON clause distinguishes whether the statement grants privileges
  or roles:

  o With ON, the statement grants privileges.

  o Without ON, the statement grants roles.

  o It is permitted to assign both privileges and roles to an account,
    but you must use separate GRANT statements, each with syntax
    appropriate to what is to be granted.

For more information about roles, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/roles.html.

To use GRANT, you must have the GRANT OPTION privilege, and you must
have the privileges that you are granting. When the read_only system
variable is enabled, GRANT additionally requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN
or SUPER privilege.

GRANT either succeeds for all named users and roles or rolls back and
has no effect if any error occurs. The statement is written to the
binary log only if it succeeds for all named users and roles.

The REVOKE statement is related to GRANT and enables administrators to
remove account privileges. See [HELP REVOKE].

Each account name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. Each role
name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. For example:

GRANT ALL ON db1.* TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
GRANT 'role1', 'role2' TO 'user1'@'localhost', 'user2'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON world.* TO 'role3';

The host name part of the account or role name, if omitted, defaults to
'%'.

Normally, a database administrator first uses CREATE USER to create an
account and define its nonprivilege characteristics such as its
password, whether it uses secure connections, and limits on access to
server resources, then uses GRANT to define its privileges. ALTER USER
may be used to change the nonprivilege characteristics of existing
accounts. For example:

CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL ON db1.* TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON db2.invoice TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 90;

From the mysql program, GRANT responds with Query OK, 0 rows affected
when executed successfully. To determine what privileges result from
the operation, use SHOW GRANTS. See [HELP SHOW GRANTS].

605,RENAME USER,37,"Syntax:
RENAME USER old_user TO new_user
    [, old_user TO new_user] ...

The RENAME USER statement renames existing MySQL accounts. An error
occurs for old accounts that do not exist or new accounts that already
exist.

To use RENAME USER, you must have the global CREATE USER privilege, or
the UPDATE privilege for the mysql system schema. When the read_only
system variable is enabled, RENAME USER additionally requires the
CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

Each account name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. For
example:

RENAME USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' TO 'jeff'@'127.0.0.1';

The host name part of the account name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

RENAME USER causes the privileges held by the old user to be those held
by the new user. However, RENAME USER does not automatically drop or
invalidate databases or objects within them that the old user created.
This includes stored programs or views for which the DEFINER attribute
names the old user. Attempts to access such objects may produce an
error if they execute in definer security context. (For information

The REVOKE statement enables system administrators to revoke privileges
and roles, which can be revoked from user accounts and roles.

For details on the levels at which privileges exist, the permissible
priv_type, priv_level, and object_type values, and the syntax for
specifying users and passwords, see [HELP GRANT].

For information about roles, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/roles.html.

When the read_only system variable is enabled, REVOKE requires the
CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege in addition to any other required
privileges described in the following discussion.

REVOKE either succeeds for all named users and roles or rolls back and
has no effect if any error occurs. The statement is written to the
binary log only if it succeeds for all named users and roles.

Each account name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. Each role
name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. For example:

REVOKE INSERT ON *.* FROM 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
REVOKE 'role1', 'role2' FROM 'user1'@'localhost', 'user2'@'localhost';
REVOKE SELECT ON world.* FROM 'role3';

The host name part of the account or role name, if omitted, defaults to
'%'.

To use the first REVOKE syntax, you must have the GRANT OPTION
privilege, and you must have the privileges that you are revoking.

To revoke all privileges, use the second syntax, which drops all
global, database, table, column, and routine privileges for the named
users or roles:

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION
  FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role] ...

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION does not revoke any roles.

To use this REVOKE syntax, you must have the global CREATE USER
privilege, or the UPDATE privilege for the mysql system schema.

The syntax for which the REVOKE keyword is followed by one or more role
names takes a FROM clause indicating one or more users or roles from
which to revoke the roles.

Roles named in the mandatory_roles system variable value cannot be
revoked.

A revoked role immediately affects any user account from which it was
revoked, such that within any current session for the account, its
privileges are adjusted for the next statement executed.

Revoking a role revokes the role itself, not the privileges that it
represents. Suppose that an account is granted a role that includes a
given privilege, and is also granted the privilege explicitly or
another role that includes the privilege. In this case, the account
still possesses that privilege if the first role is revoked. For
example, if an account is granted two roles that each include SELECT,
the account still can select after either role is revoked.

REVOKE ALL ON *.* (at the global level) revokes all granted static
global privileges and all granted dynamic privileges.

User accounts and roles from which privileges and roles are to be
revoked must exist, but the privileges and roles to be revoked need not
be currently granted to them.

A revoked privilege that is granted but not known to the server is
revoked with a warning. This situtation can occur for dynamic
privileges. For example, a dynamic privilege can be granted while the
component that registers it is installed, but if that component is
subsequently uninstalled, the privilege becomes unregistered, although
accounts that possess the privilege still possess it and it can be
revoked from them.

607,SET DEFAULT ROLE,37,"Syntax:
SET DEFAULT ROLE
    {NONE | ALL | role [, role ] ...}
    TO user [, user ] ...

For each user named immediately after the TO keyword, this statement
defines which roles become active when the user connects to the server
and authenticates, or when the user executes the SET ROLE DEFAULT
statement during a session.

SET DEFAULT ROLE is alternative syntax for ALTER USER ... DEFAULT ROLE
(see [HELP ALTER USER]). However, ALTER USER can set the default for
only a single user, whereas SET DEFAULT ROLE can set the default for
multiple users. On the other hand, you can specify CURRENT_USER as the
user name for the ALTER USER statement, whereas you cannot for SET
DEFAULT ROLE.

SET DEFAULT ROLE requires these privileges:

o Setting the default roles for another user requires the global CREATE
  USER privilege, or the UPDATE privilege for the mysql.default_roles
  system table.

o Setting the default roles for yourself requires no special
  privileges, as long as the roles you want as the default have been
  granted to you.

Each role name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. For example:

SET DEFAULT ROLE administrator, developer TO 'joe'@'10.0.0.1';

The host name part of the role name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

The clause following the DEFAULT ROLE keywords permits these values:

o NONE: Set the default to NONE (no roles).

o ALL: Set the default to all roles granted to the account.

o role [, role ] ...: Set the default to the named roles, which must
  exist and be granted to the account at the time SET DEFAULT ROLE is
  executed.

608,SET PASSWORD,37,"Syntax:
SET PASSWORD [FOR user] auth_option
    [REPLACE 'current_auth_string']
    [RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD]

auth_option: {
    = 'auth_string'
  | TO RANDOM
}

The SET PASSWORD statement assigns a password to a MySQL user account.
The password may be either explicitly specified in the statement or
randomly generated by MySQL. The statement may also include a
password-verification clause that specifies the account current
password to be replaced, and a clause that manages whether an account
has a secondary password. 'auth_string' and 'current_auth_string' each
represent a cleartext (unencrypted) password.

*Note*:

Rather than using SET PASSWORD to assign passwords, ALTER USER is the
preferred statement for account alterations, including assigning
passwords. For example:

ALTER USER user IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string';

*Note*:

Clauses for random password generation, password verification, and
secondary passwords apply only to accounts that use an authentication
plugin that stores credentials internally to MySQL. For accounts that
use a plugin that performs authentication against a credentials system
that is external to MySQL, password management must be handled
externally against that system as well. For more information about
internal credentials storage, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-management.html.

The REPLACE 'current_auth_string' clause performs password verification
and is available as of MySQL 8.0.13. If given:

o REPLACE specifies the account current password to be replaced, as a
  cleartext (unencrypted) string.

o The clause must be given if password changes for the account are
  required to specify the current password, as verification that the
  user attempting to make the change actually knows the current
  password.

o The clause is optional if password changes for the account may but
  need not specify the current password.

o The statement fails if the clause is given but does not match the
  current password, even if the clause is optional.

o REPLACE can be specified only when changing the account password for
  the current user.

For more information about password verification by specifying the
current password, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-management.html.

The RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD clause implements dual-password capability
and is available as of MySQL 8.0.14. If given:

o RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD retains an account current password as its
  secondary password, replacing any existing secondary password. The
  new password becomes the primary password, but clients can use the
  account to connect to the server using either the primary or
  secondary password. (Exception: If the new password specified by the
  SET PASSWORD statement is empty, the secondary password becomes empty
  as well, even if RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD is given.)

o If you specify RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD for an account that has an
  empty primary password, the statement fails.

o If an account has a secondary password and you change its primary
  password without specifying RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD, the secondary
  password remains unchanged.

For more information about use of dual passwords, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-management.html.

SET PASSWORD permits these auth_option syntaxes:

o = 'auth_string'

  Assigns the account the given literal password.

o TO RANDOM

  Assigns the account a password randomly generated by MySQL. The
  statement also returns the cleartext password in a result set to make
  it available to the user or application executing the statement.

  For details about the result set and characteristics of randomly
  generated passwords, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-management.html#rand
  om-password-generation.

  Random password generation is available as of MySQL 8.0.18.

*Important*:

Under some circumstances, SET PASSWORD may be recorded in server logs
or on the client side in a history file such as ~/.mysql_history, which
means that cleartext passwords may be read by anyone having read access
to that information. For information about the conditions under which
this occurs for the server logs and how to control it, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-logging.html. For
similar information about client-side logging, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-logging.html.

SET PASSWORD can be used with or without a FOR clause that explicitly
names a user account:

o With a FOR user clause, the statement sets the password for the named
  account, which must exist:

SET PASSWORD FOR 'jeffrey'@'localhost' = 'auth_string';

o With no FOR user clause, the statement sets the password for the
  current user:

SET PASSWORD = 'auth_string';

  Any client who connects to the server using a nonanonymous account
  can change the password for that account. (In particular, you can
  change your own password.) To see which account the server
  authenticated you as, invoke the CURRENT_USER() function:

SELECT CURRENT_USER();

If a FOR user clause is given, the account name uses the format
described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. For
example:

SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.example.org' = 'auth_string';

The host name part of the account name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

SET PASSWORD interprets the string as a cleartext string, passes it to
the authentication plugin associated with the account, and stores the
result returned by the plugin in the account row in the mysql.user
system table. (The plugin is given the opportunity to hash the value
into the encryption format it expects. The plugin may use the value as
specified, in which case no hashing occurs.)

Setting the password for a named account (with a FOR clause) requires
the UPDATE privilege for the mysql system schema. Setting the password
for yourself (for a nonanonymous account with no FOR clause) requires
no special privileges.

Statements that modify secondary passwords require these privileges:

o The APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN privilege is required to use the
  RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD clause for SET PASSWORD statements that apply
  to your own account. The privilege is required to manipulate your own
  secondary password because most users require only one password.

o If an account is to be permitted to manipulate secondary passwords
  for all accounts, it should be granted the CREATE USER privilege
  rather than APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN.

When the read_only system variable is enabled, SET PASSWORD requires
the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege in addition to any other
required privileges.

609,SET ROLE,37,"Syntax:
SET ROLE {
    DEFAULT
  | NONE
  | ALL
  | ALL EXCEPT role [, role ] ...
  | role [, role ] ...
}

SET ROLE modifies the current user's effective privileges within the
current session by specifying which of its granted roles are active.
Granted roles include those granted explicitly to the user and those
named in the mandatory_roles system variable value.

Examples:

SET ROLE DEFAULT;
SET ROLE 'role1', 'role2';
SET ROLE ALL;
SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT 'role1', 'role2';

Each role name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. The host name
part of the role name, if omitted, defaults to '%'.

Privileges that the user has been granted directly (rather than through
roles) remain unaffected by changes to the active roles.

The statement permits these role specifiers:

o DEFAULT: Activate the account default roles. Default roles are those
  specified with SET DEFAULT ROLE.

  When a user connects to the server and authenticates successfully,
  the server determines which roles to activate as the default roles.
  If the activate_all_roles_on_login system variable is enabled, the
  server activates all granted roles. Otherwise, the server executes
  SET ROLE DEFAULT implicitly. The server activates only default roles
  that can be activated. The server writes warnings to its error log
  for default roles that cannot be activated, but the client receives
  no warnings.

  If a user executes SET ROLE DEFAULT during a session, an error occurs
  if any default role cannot be activated (for example, if it does not
  exist or is not granted to the user). In this case, the current
  active roles are not changed.

o NONE: Set the active roles to NONE (no active roles).

o ALL: Activate all roles granted to the account.

o ALL EXCEPT role [, role ] ...: Activate all roles granted to the
  account except those named. The named roles need not exist or be
  granted to the account.

o role [, role ] ...: Activate the named roles, which must be granted
  to the account.

ALTER RESOURCE GROUP is used for resource group management (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/resource-groups.html). This
statement alters modifiable attributes of an existing resource group.
It requires the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN privilege.

group_name identifies which resource group to alter. If the group does
not exist, an error occurs.

The attributes for CPU affinity, priority, and whether the group is
enabled can be modified with ALTER RESOURCE GROUP. These attributes are
specified the same way as described for CREATE RESOURCE GROUP (see
[HELP CREATE RESOURCE GROUP]). Only the attributes specified are
altered. Unspecified attributes retain their current values.

The FORCE modifier is used with DISABLE. It determines statement
behavior if the resource group has any threads assigned to it:

o If FORCE is not given, existing threads in the group continue to run
  until they terminate, but new threads cannot be assigned to the
  group.

o If FORCE is given, existing threads in the group are moved to their
  respective default group (system threads to SYS_default, user threads
  to USR_default).

The name and type attributes are set at group creation time and cannot
be modified thereafter with ALTER RESOURCE GROUP.

Examples:

o Alter a group CPU affinity:

ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg1 VCPU = 0-63;

o Alter a group thread priority:

ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg2 THREAD_PRIORITY = 5;

o Disable a group, moving any threads assigned to it to the default
  groups:

ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg3 DISABLE FORCE;

Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs.

CREATE RESOURCE GROUP is used for resource group management (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/resource-groups.html). This
statement creates a new resource group and assigns its initial
attribute values. It requires the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN privilege.

group_name identifies which resource group to create. If the group
already exists, an error occurs.

The TYPE attribute is required. It should be SYSTEM for a system
resource group, USER for a user resource group. The group type affects
permitted THREAD_PRIORITY values, as described later.

The VCPU attribute indicates the CPU affinity; that is, the set of
virtual CPUs the group can use:

o If VCPU is not given, the resource group has no CPU affinity and can
  use all available CPUs.

o If VCPU is given, the attribute value is a list of comma-separated
  CPU numbers or ranges:

  o Each number must be an integer in the range from 0 to the number of
    CPUs − 1. For example, on a system with 64 CPUs, the number can
    range from 0 to 63.

  o A range is given in the form M − N, where M is less than or equal
    to N and both numbers are in the CPU range.

  o If a CPU number is an integer outside the permitted range or is not
    an integer, an error occurs.

Example VCPU specifiers (these are all equivalent):

VCPU = 0,1,2,3,9,10
VCPU = 0-3,9-10
VCPU = 9,10,0-3
VCPU = 0,10,1,9,3,2

The THREAD_PRIORITY attribute indicates the priority for threads
assigned to the group:

o If THREAD_PRIORITY is not given, the default priority is 0.

o If THREAD_PRIORITY is given, the attribute value must be in the range
  from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). The priority for
  system resource groups must be in the range from -20 to 0. The
  priority for user resource groups must be in the range from 0 to 19.
  Use of different ranges for system and user groups ensures that user
  threads never have a higher priority than system threads.

ENABLE and DISABLE specify that the resource group is initially enabled
or disabled. If neither is specified, the group is enabled by default.
A disabled group cannot have threads assigned to it.

Examples:

o Create an enabled user group that has a single CPU and the lowest
  priority:

CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg1
  TYPE = USER
  VCPU = 0
  THREAD_PRIORITY = 19;

o Create a disabled system group that has no CPU affinity (can use all
  CPUs) and the highest priority:

CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg2
  TYPE = SYSTEM
  THREAD_PRIORITY = -20
  DISABLE;

statement drops a resource group. It requires the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN
privilege.

group_name identifies which resource group to drop. If the group does
not exist, an error occurs.

The FORCE modifier determines statement behavior if the resource group
has any threads assigned to it:

o If FORCE is not given and any threads are assigned to the group, an
  error occurs.

statement assigns threads to a resource group. It requires the
RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN or RESOURCE_GROUP_USER privilege.

group_name identifies which resource group to be assigned. Any
thread_id values indicate threads to assign to the group. Thread IDs
can be determined from the Performance Schema threads table. If the
resource group or any named thread ID does not exist, an error occurs.

With no FOR clause, the statement assigns the current thread for the
session to the resource group.

With a FOR clause that names thread IDs, the statement assigns those
threads to the resource group.

For attempts to assign a system thread to a user resource group or a
user thread to a system resource group, a warning occurs.

ANALYZE TABLE generates table statistics:

o ANALYZE TABLE without either HISTOGRAM clause performs a key
  distribution analysis and stores the distribution for the named table
  or tables. For MyISAM tables, ANALYZE TABLE for key distribution
  analysis is equivalent to using myisamchk --analyze.

o ANALYZE TABLE with the UPDATE HISTOGRAM clause generates histogram
  statistics for the named table columns and stores them in the data
  dictionary. Only one table name is permitted for this syntax.

o ANALYZE TABLE with the DROP HISTOGRAM clause removes histogram
  statistics for the named table columns from the data dictionary. Only
  one table name is permitted for this syntax.

This statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.

ANALYZE TABLE works with InnoDB, NDB, and MyISAM tables. It does not
work with views.

If the innodb_read_only system variable is enabled, ANALYZE TABLE may
fail because it cannot update statistics tables in the data dictionary,
which use InnoDB. For ANALYZE TABLE operations that update the key
distribution, failure may occur even if the operation updates the table
itself (for example, if it is a MyISAM table). To obtain the updated
distribution statistics, set information_schema_stats_expiry=0.

ANALYZE TABLE is supported for partitioned tables, and you can use
ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE PARTITION to analyze one or more partitions;
for more information, see [HELP ALTER TABLE], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-maintenance.html.

During the analysis, the table is locked with a read lock for InnoDB
and MyISAM.

ANALYZE TABLE removes the table from the table definition cache, which
requires a flush lock. If there are long running statements or
transactions still using the table, subsequent statements and
transactions must wait for those operations to finish before the flush
lock is released. Because ANALYZE TABLE itself typically finishes
quickly, it may not be apparent that delayed transactions or statements
involving the same table are due to the remaining flush lock.

By default, the server writes ANALYZE TABLE statements to the binary
log so that they replicate to replication slaves. To suppress logging,
specify the optional NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword or its alias LOCAL.

CHECK TABLE checks a table or tables for errors. CHECK TABLE can also
check views for problems, such as tables that are referenced in the
view definition that no longer exist.

OPTIMIZE [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL]
    TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...

OPTIMIZE TABLE reorganizes the physical storage of table data and
associated index data, to reduce storage space and improve I/O
efficiency when accessing the table. The exact changes made to each
table depend on the storage engine used by that table.

Use OPTIMIZE TABLE in these cases, depending on the type of table:

o After doing substantial insert, update, or delete operations on an
  InnoDB table that has its own .ibd file because it was created with
  the innodb_file_per_table option enabled. The table and indexes are
  reorganized, and disk space can be reclaimed for use by the operating
  system.

o After doing substantial insert, update, or delete operations on
  columns that are part of a FULLTEXT index in an InnoDB table. Set the
  configuration option innodb_optimize_fulltext_only=1 first. To keep
  the index maintenance period to a reasonable time, set the
  innodb_ft_num_word_optimize option to specify how many words to
  update in the search index, and run a sequence of OPTIMIZE TABLE
  statements until the search index is fully updated.

o After deleting a large part of a MyISAM or ARCHIVE table, or making
  many changes to a MyISAM or ARCHIVE table with variable-length rows
  (tables that have VARCHAR, VARBINARY, BLOB, or TEXT columns). Deleted
  rows are maintained in a linked list and subsequent INSERT operations
  reuse old row positions. You can use OPTIMIZE TABLE to reclaim the
  unused space and to defragment the data file. After extensive changes
  to a table, this statement may also improve performance of statements
  that use the table, sometimes significantly.

This statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.

OPTIMIZE TABLE works for InnoDB, MyISAM, and ARCHIVE tables. OPTIMIZE
TABLE is also supported for dynamic columns of in-memory NDB tables. It
does not work for fixed-width columns of in-memory tables, nor does it
work for Disk Data tables. The performance of OPTIMIZE on NDB Cluster
tables can be tuned using --ndb-optimization-delay, which controls the
length of time to wait between processing batches of rows by OPTIMIZE
TABLE. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-limitations-resol
ved.html.

For NDB Cluster tables, OPTIMIZE TABLE can be interrupted by (for
example) killing the SQL thread performing the OPTIMIZE operation.

By default, OPTIMIZE TABLE does not work for tables created using any
other storage engine and returns a result indicating this lack of
support. You can make OPTIMIZE TABLE work for other storage engines by
starting mysqld with the --skip-new option. In this case, OPTIMIZE
TABLE is just mapped to ALTER TABLE.

This statement does not work with views.

OPTIMIZE TABLE is supported for partitioned tables. For information
about using this statement with partitioned tables and table

By default, the server writes OPTIMIZE TABLE statements to the binary
log so that they replicate to replication slaves. To suppress logging,
specify the optional NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword or its alias LOCAL.

618,REPAIR TABLE,38,"Syntax:
REPAIR [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL]
    TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...
    [QUICK] [EXTENDED] [USE_FRM]

REPAIR TABLE repairs a possibly corrupted table, for certain storage
engines only.

This statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.

Although normally you should never have to run REPAIR TABLE, if
disaster strikes, this statement is very likely to get back all your
data from a MyISAM table. If your tables become corrupted often, try to
find the reason for it, to eliminate the need to use REPAIR TABLE. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/crashing.html, and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-table-problems.html.

REPAIR TABLE checks the table to see whether an upgrade is required. If
so, it performs the upgrade, following the same rules as CHECK TABLE
... FOR UPGRADE. See [HELP CHECK TABLE], for more information.

*Important*:

o Make a backup of a table before performing a table repair operation;
  under some circumstances the operation might cause data loss.
  Possible causes include but are not limited to file system errors.
  See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/backup-and-recovery.html.

o If the server crashes during a REPAIR TABLE operation, it is
  essential after restarting it that you immediately execute another
  REPAIR TABLE statement for the table before performing any other
  operations on it. In the worst case, you might have a new clean index
  file without information about the data file, and then the next
  operation you perform could overwrite the data file. This is an
  unlikely but possible scenario that underscores the value of making a
  backup first.

o In the event that a table on the master becomes corrupted and you run
  REPAIR TABLE on it, any resulting changes to the original table are
  not propagated to slaves.

619,CREATE FUNCTION UDF,39,"Syntax:
CREATE [AGGREGATE] FUNCTION function_name
    RETURNS {STRING|INTEGER|REAL|DECIMAL}
    SONAME shared_library_name

A user-defined function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like a native (built-in) MySQL function such as
ABS() or CONCAT().

function_name is the name that should be used in SQL statements to
invoke the function. The RETURNS clause indicates the type of the
function's return value. DECIMAL is a legal value after RETURNS, but
currently DECIMAL functions return string values and should be written
like STRING functions.

shared_library_name is the base name of the shared library file that
contains the code that implements the function. The file must be
located in the plugin directory. This directory is given by the value
of the plugin_dir system variable. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/udf-loading.html.

To create a function, you must have the INSERT privilege for the mysql
system schema. This is necessary because CREATE FUNCTION adds a row to
the mysql.func system table that records the function's name, type, and
shared library name.

UDFs registered using CREATE FUNCTION are listed in the Performance
Schema user_defined_functions table; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/user-defined-functions-table.ht

620,DROP FUNCTION UDF,39,"Syntax:
DROP FUNCTION function_name

This statement drops the user-defined function (UDF) named
function_name.

To drop a function, you must have the DELETE privilege for the mysql
system schema. This is because DROP FUNCTION removes a row from the
mysql.func system table that records the function's name, type, and
shared library name.

621,INSTALL COMPONENT,40,"Syntax:
INSTALL COMPONENT component_name [, component_name ] ...

This statement installs one or more server components, which become
active immediately. A component provides services that are available to
the server and other components; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-components.html. INSTALL
COMPONENT requires the INSERT privilege for the mysql.component system
table.

Example:

INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2';

Component names are URNs that begin with file:// and indicate the base
name of the file that implements the component, located in the
directory named by the plugin_dir system variable. Component names do
not include any platform-dependent file name suffix such as .so or
.dll. (These naming details are subject to change because component
name interpretation is itself performed by a service and the component
infrastructure makes it possible to replace the default service
implementation with alternative implementations.)

If any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For
example, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named
component does not exist or is already installed, or component
initialization fails.

A loader service handles component loading, which includes adding
installed components to the mysql.component system table that serves as
a registry. For subsequent server restarts, any components listed in
mysql.component are loaded by the loader service during the startup
sequence. This occurs even if the server is started with the
--skip-grant-tables option.

If a component depends on services not present in the registry and you
attempt to install the component without also installing the component
or components that provide the services on which it depends, an error
occurs:

ERROR 3527 (HY000): Cannot satisfy dependency for service 'component_a'
required by component 'component_b'.

To avoid this problem, either install all components in the same
statement, or install the dependent component after installing any
components on which it depends.

","",https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/install-component.html
622,INSTALL PLUGIN,41,"Syntax:
INSTALL PLUGIN plugin_name SONAME 'shared_library_name'

This statement installs a server plugin. It requires the INSERT
privilege for the mysql.plugin system table.

plugin_name is the name of the plugin as defined in the plugin
descriptor structure contained in the library file (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/plugin-data-structures.html).
Plugin names are not case-sensitive. For maximal compatibility, plugin
names should be limited to ASCII letters, digits, and underscore
because they are used in C source files, shell command lines, M4 and
Bourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.

shared_library_name is the name of the shared library that contains the
plugin code. The name includes the file name extension (for example,
libmyplugin.so, libmyplugin.dll, or libmyplugin.dylib).

The shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the
directory named by the plugin_dir system variable). The library must be
in the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. By default,
plugin_dir is the plugin directory under the directory named by the
pkglibdir configuration variable, but it can be changed by setting the
value of plugin_dir at server startup. For example, set its value in a
my.cnf file:

[mysqld]
plugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory

If the value of plugin_dir is a relative path name, it is taken to be
relative to the MySQL base directory (the value of the basedir system
variable).

INSTALL PLUGIN loads and initializes the plugin code to make the plugin
available for use. A plugin is initialized by executing its
initialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must
perform before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes
the deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so that
the plugin has a chance to perform any final cleanup.

INSTALL PLUGIN also registers the plugin by adding a line that
indicates the plugin name and library file name to the mysql.plugin
system table. At server startup, the server loads and initializes any
plugin that is listed in mysql.plugin. This means that a plugin is
installed with INSTALL PLUGIN only once, not every time the server
starts. Plugin loading at startup does not occur if the server is
started with the --skip-grant-tables option.

A plugin library can contain multiple plugins. For each of them to be
installed, use a separate INSTALL PLUGIN statement. Each statement
names a different plugin, but all of them specify the same library
name.

623,UNINSTALL COMPONENT,40,"Syntax:
UNINSTALL COMPONENT component_name [, component_name ] ...

This statement deactivates and uninstalls one or more server
components. A component provides services that are available to the
server and other components; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-components.html.
UNINSTALL COMPONENT is the complement of INSTALL COMPONENT. It requires
the DELETE privilege for the mysql.component system table.

Example:

UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2';

For information about component naming, see [HELP INSTALL COMPONENT].

If any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For
example, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named
component is not installed, or cannot be uninstalled because other
installed components depend on it.

A loader service handles component unloading, which includes removing
uninstalled components from the mysql.component system table that
serves as a registry. As a result, unloaded components are not loaded
during the startup sequence for subsequent server restarts.

UNINSTALL PLUGIN plugin_name

This statement removes an installed server plugin. It requires the
DELETE privilege for the mysql.plugin system table. UNINSTALL PLUGIN is
the complement of INSTALL PLUGIN.

plugin_name must be the name of some plugin that is listed in the
mysql.plugin table. The server executes the plugin's deinitialization
function and removes the row for the plugin from the mysql.plugin
system table, so that subsequent server restarts will not load and
initialize the plugin. UNINSTALL PLUGIN does not remove the plugin's
shared library file.

  | INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'host':port
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
    [DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir']
    [REQUIRE [NO] SSL]
}	

The CLONE statement is used to clone data locally or from a remote
MySQL server instance. To use CLONE syntax, the clone plugin must be
installed. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin.html.

CLONE LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY syntax clones data from the local MySQL data
directory to a directory on the same server or node where the MySQL
server instance runs. The 'clone_dir' directory is the full path of the
local directory that data is cloned to. An absolute path is required.
The specified directory must not exist, but the specified path must be
an existent path. The MySQL server requires the necessary write access
to create the specified directory. For more information, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin-local.html.

CLONE INSTANCE syntax clones data from a remote MySQL server instance
(the donor) and transfers it to the MySQL instance where the cloning
operation was initiated (the recipient).

o user is the clone user on the donor MySQL server instance.

o host is the hostname address of the donor MySQL server instance.
  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address format is not supported.
  An alias to the IPv6 address can be used instead. An IPv4 address can
  be used as is.

o port is the port number of the donor MySQL server instance. (The X
  Protocol port specified by mysqlx_port is not supported. Connecting
  to the donor MySQL server instance through MySQL Router is also not
  supported.)

o IDENTIFIED BY 'password' specifies the password of the clone user on
  the donor MySQL server instance.

o DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir' is an optional clause used to specify
  a directory on the recipient for the data you are cloning. Use this
  option if you do not want to remove existing data in the recipient
  data directory. An absolute path is required, and the directory must
  not exist. The MySQL server must have the necessary write access to
  create the directory.

  When the optional DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir' clause is not used,
  a cloning operation removes existing data in the recipient data
  directory, replaces it with the cloned data, and automatically
  restarts the server afterward.

o [REQUIRE [NO] SSL] explicitly specifies whether an encrypted
  connection is to be used or not when transferring cloned data over
  the network. An error is returned if the explicit specification
  cannot be satisfied. If an SSL clause is not specified, clone
  attempts to establish an encrypted connection by default, falling
  back to an insecure connection if the secure connection attempt
  fails. A secure connection is required when cloning encrypted data
  regardless of whether this clause is specified. For more information,
  see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin-remote.html#clon
  e-plugin-remote-ssl.

An alternative to tbl_name FROM db_name syntax is db_name.tbl_name.
These two statements are equivalent:

SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable FROM mydb;
SHOW COLUMNS FROM mydb.mytable;

The optional EXTENDED keyword causes the output to include information
about hidden columns that MySQL uses internally and are not accessible
by users.

The optional FULL keyword causes the output to include the column
collation and comments, as well as the privileges you have for each
column.

The LIKE clause, if present, indicates which column names to match. The
WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more general conditions,
as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extended-show.html.

The data types may differ from what you expect them to be based on a
CREATE TABLE statement because MySQL sometimes changes data types when
you create or alter a table. The conditions under which this occurs are
described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/silent-column-changes.html.

SHOW COLUMNS displays the following values for each table column:

o Field

  The name of the column.

o Type

  The column data type.

o Collation

  The collation for nonbinary string columns, or NULL for other
  columns. This value is displayed only if you use the FULL keyword.

o Null

  The column nullability. The value is YES if NULL values can be stored
  in the column, NO if not.

o Key

  Whether the column is indexed:

  o If Key is empty, the column either is not indexed or is indexed
    only as a secondary column in a multiple-column, nonunique index.

  o If Key is PRI, the column is a PRIMARY KEY or is one of the columns
    in a multiple-column PRIMARY KEY.

  o If Key is UNI, the column is the first column of a UNIQUE index. (A
    UNIQUE index permits multiple NULL values, but you can tell whether
    the column permits NULL by checking the Null field.)

  o If Key is MUL, the column is the first column of a nonunique index
    in which multiple occurrences of a given value are permitted within
    the column.

  If more than one of the Key values applies to a given column of a
  table, Key displays the one with the highest priority, in the order
  PRI, UNI, MUL.

  A UNIQUE index may be displayed as PRI if it cannot contain NULL
  values and there is no PRIMARY KEY in the table. A UNIQUE index may
  display as MUL if several columns form a composite UNIQUE index;
  although the combination of the columns is unique, each column can
  still hold multiple occurrences of a given value.

o Default

  The default value for the column. This is NULL if the column has an
  explicit default of NULL, or if the column definition includes no
  DEFAULT clause.

o Extra

  Any additional information that is available about a given column.
  The value is nonempty in these cases:

  o auto_increment for columns that have the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute.

  o on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for TIMESTAMP or DATETIME columns that
    have the ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attribute.

  o VIRTUAL GENERATED or VIRTUAL STORED for generated columns.

  o DEFAULT_GENERATED for columns that have an expression default
    value.

o Privileges

  The privileges you have for the column. This value is displayed only
  if you use the FULL keyword.

o Comment

  Any comment included in the column definition. This value is
  displayed only if you use the FULL keyword.

Table column information is also available from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
COLUMNS table. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/columns-table.html. The
extended information about hidden columns is available only using SHOW
EXTENDED COLUMNS; it cannot be obtained from the COLUMNS table.

You can list a table's columns with the mysqlshow db_name tbl_name
command.

The DESCRIBE statement provides information similar to SHOW COLUMNS.
See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/describe.html.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, MySQL implements CHECK constraints and SHOW CREATE
TABLE displays them. All CHECK constraints are displayed as table
constraints. That is, a CHECK constraint originally specified as part
of a column definition displays as a separate clause not part of the
column definition. Example:

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
         i1 INT CHECK (i1 <> 0),      -- column constraint
         i2 INT,
         CHECK (i2 > i1),             -- table constraint

SHOW CREATE USER user

This statement shows the CREATE USER statement that creates the named

requires the SELECT privilege for the mysql system schema, except to
see information for the current user. For the current user, the SELECT
privilege for the mysql.user system table is required for display of
the password hash in the IDENTIFIED AS clause; otherwise, the hash
displays as <secret>.

To name the account, use the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. The host
name part of the account name, if omitted, defaults to '%'. It is also
possible to specify CURRENT_USER or CURRENT_USER() to refer to the
account associated with the current session.

Password hash values displayed in the IDENTIFIED WITH clause of output
from SHOW CREATE USER may contain unprintable characters that have
adverse effects on terminal displays and in other environments.
Enabling the print_identified_with_as_hex system variable (available as
of MySQL 8.0.17) causes SHOW CREATE USER to display such hash values as
hexadecimal strings rather than as regular string literals. Hash values
that do not contain unprintable characters still display as regular
string literals, even with this variable enabled.

If the server was started with the --skip-show-database option, you
cannot use this statement at all unless you have the SHOW DATABASES

SHOW ENGINE engine_name {STATUS | MUTEX}

SHOW ENGINE displays operational information about a storage engine. It
requires the PROCESS privilege. The statement has these variants:

SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS
SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX
SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS

SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS displays extensive information from the
standard InnoDB Monitor about the state of the InnoDB storage engine.
For information about the standard monitor and other InnoDB Monitors
that provide information about InnoDB processing, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-monitors.html.

SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX displays InnoDB mutex and rw-lock statistics.

*Note*:

InnoDB mutexes and rwlocks can also be monitored using Performance
Schema tables. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-perf
ormance-schema.html.

Mutex statistics collection is configured dynamically using the
following options:

o To enable the collection of mutex statistics, run:

SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable='latch';

o To reset mutex statistics, run:

SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_reset='latch';

o To disable the collection of mutex statistics, run:

SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_disable='latch';

Collection of mutex statistics for SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX can also be
enabled by setting innodb_monitor_enable='all', or disabled by setting
innodb_monitor_disable='all'.

SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX output has these columns:

o Type

  Always InnoDB.

o Name

  For mutexes, the Name field reports only the mutex name. For rwlocks,
  the Name field reports the source file where the rwlock is
  implemented, and the line number in the file where the rwlock is
  created. The line number is specific to your version of MySQL.

o Status

  The mutex status. This field reports the number of spins, waits, and
  calls. Statistics for low-level operating system mutexes, which are
  implemented outside of InnoDB, are not reported.

  o spins indicates the number of spins.

  o waits indicates the number of mutex waits.

  o calls indicates how many times the mutex was requested.

SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX skips the mutexes and rw-locks of buffer pool
blocks, as the amount of output can be overwhelming on systems with a
large buffer pool. (There is one mutex and one rw-lock in each 16K
buffer pool block, and there are 65,536 blocks per gigabyte.) SHOW
ENGINE INNODB MUTEX also does not list any mutexes or rw-locks that
have never been waited on (os_waits=0). Thus, SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX
only displays information about mutexes and rw-locks outside of the
buffer pool that have caused at least one OS-level wait.

Use SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS to inspect the internal
operation of the Performance Schema code:

mysql> SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\G
...
*************************** 3. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.size
Status: 76
*************************** 4. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.count
Status: 10000
*************************** 5. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.memory
Status: 760000
...
*************************** 57. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: performance_schema.memory
Status: 26459600
...

This statement is intended to help the DBA understand the effects that
different Performance Schema options have on memory requirements.

Name values consist of two parts, which name an internal buffer and a
buffer attribute, respectively. Interpret buffer names as follows:

o An internal buffer that is not exposed as a table is named within
  parentheses. Examples: (pfs_cond_class).size,
  (pfs_mutex_class).memory.

o An internal buffer that is exposed as a table in the
  performance_schema database is named after the table, without
  parentheses. Examples: events_waits_history.size,
  mutex_instances.count.

o A value that applies to the Performance Schema as a whole begins with
  performance_schema. Example: performance_schema.memory.

Buffer attributes have these meanings:

o size is the size of the internal record used by the implementation,
  such as the size of a row in a table. size values cannot be changed.

o count is the number of internal records, such as the number of rows
  in a table. count values can be changed using Performance Schema
  configuration options.

o For a table, tbl_name.memory is the product of size and count. For
  the Performance Schema as a whole, performance_schema.memory is the
  sum of all the memory used (the sum of all other memory values).

In some cases, there is a direct relationship between a Performance
Schema configuration parameter and a SHOW ENGINE value. For example,
events_waits_history_long.count corresponds to
performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size. In other cases, the
relationship is more complex. For example, events_waits_history.count
corresponds to performance_schema_events_waits_history_size (the number
of rows per thread) multiplied by
performance_schema_max_thread_instances ( the number of threads).

SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS If the server has the NDB storage engine
enabled, SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS displays cluster status information
such as the number of connected data nodes, the cluster connectstring,
and cluster binary log epochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API
objects created by the MySQL Server when connected to the cluster.
Sample output from this statement is shown here:

engine is supported, or to see what the default engine is.

For information about MySQL storage engines, see

651,SHOW ERRORS,3,"Syntax:
SHOW ERRORS [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS

SHOW ERRORS is a diagnostic statement that is similar to SHOW WARNINGS,
except that it displays information only for errors, rather than for
errors, warnings, and notes.

The LIMIT clause has the same syntax as for the SELECT statement. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html.

The SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS statement displays the number of errors. You
can also retrieve this number from the error_count variable:

SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS;
SELECT @@error_count;

SHOW ERRORS and error_count apply only to errors, not warnings or
notes. In other respects, they are similar to SHOW WARNINGS and
warning_count. In particular, SHOW ERRORS cannot display information
for more than max_error_count messages, and error_count can exceed the
value of max_error_count if the number of errors exceeds
max_error_count.

652,SHOW EVENTS,3,"Syntax:
SHOW EVENTS

This statement displays information about Event Manager events, which
are discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/event-scheduler.html. It
requires the EVENT privilege for the database from which the events are
to be shown.

In its simplest form, SHOW EVENTS lists all of the events in the
current schema:

mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER(), SCHEMA();
+----------------+----------+
| CURRENT_USER() | SCHEMA() |
+----------------+----------+
| jon@ghidora    | myschema |

  Database Collation: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci

To see events for a specific schema, use the FROM clause. For example,
to see events for the test schema, use the following statement:

SHOW EVENTS FROM test;

The LIKE clause, if present, indicates which event names to match. The
WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more general conditions,
as discussed in

SHOW GRANTS
    [FOR user_or_role
        [USING role [, role] ...]]

user_or_role: {
    user (see )
  | role (see .
}

This statement displays the privileges and roles that are assigned to a
MySQL user account or role, in the form of GRANT statements that must
be executed to duplicate the privilege and role assignments.

*Note*:

To display nonprivilege information for MySQL accounts, use the SHOW
CREATE USER statement. See [HELP SHOW CREATE USER].

SHOW GRANTS requires the SELECT privilege for the mysql system schema,
except to display privileges and roles for the current user.

To name the account or role for SHOW GRANTS, use the same format as for
the GRANT statement (for example, 'jeffrey'@'localhost'):

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for jeffrey@localhost                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `jeffrey`@`localhost`                      |
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON `db1`.* TO `jeffrey`@`localhost` |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

The host part, if omitted, defaults to '%'. For additional information
about specifying account and role names, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html, and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html.

To display the privileges granted to the current user (the account you
are using to connect to the server), you can use any of the following
statements:

SHOW GRANTS;
SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;
SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();

If SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER (or any equivalent syntax) is used in
definer context, such as within a stored procedure that executes with
definer rather than invoker privileges, the grants displayed are those
of the definer and not the invoker.

In MySQL 8.0 compared to previous series, SHOW GRANTS no longer
displays ALL PRIVILEGES in its global-privileges output because the
meaning of ALL PRIVILEGES at the global level varies depending on which
dynamic privileges are defined. Instead, SHOW GRANTS explictly lists
each granted global privilege:

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for root@localhost                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD,         |
| SHUTDOWN, PROCESS, FILE, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES,  |
| SUPER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION   |
| SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE,  |
| ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER, CREATE TABLESPACE,      |
| CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE ON *.* TO `root`@`localhost` WITH GRANT      |
| OPTION                                                              |
| GRANT PROXY ON ''@'' TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Applications that process SHOW GRANTS output should be adjusted
accordingly.

At the global level, GRANT OPTION applies to all granted static global
privileges if granted for any of them, but applies individually to
granted dynamic privileges. SHOW GRANTS displays global privileges this
way:

o One line listing all granted static privileges, if there are any,
  including WITH GRANT OPTION if appropriate.

o One line listing all granted dynamic privileges for which GRANT
  OPTION is granted, if there are any, including WITH GRANT OPTION.

o One line listing all granted dynamic privileges for which GRANT
  OPTION is not granted, if there are any, without WITH GRANT OPTION.

With the optional USING clause, SHOW GRANTS enables you to examine the
privileges associated with roles for the user. Each role named in the
USING clause must be granted to the user.

Suppose that user u1 is assigned roles r1 and r2, as follows:

CREATE ROLE 'r1', 'r2';
GRANT SELECT ON db1.* TO 'r1';
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON db1.* TO 'r2';
CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'u1pass';
GRANT 'r1', 'r2' TO 'u1'@'localhost';

SHOW GRANTS without USING shows the granted roles:

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u1'@'localhost';
+---------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@localhost                     |
+---------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`localhost`      |
| GRANT `r1`@`%`,`r2`@`%` TO `u1`@`localhost` |
+---------------------------------------------+

Adding a USING clause causes the statement to also display the
privileges associated with each role named in the clause:

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u1'@'localhost' USING 'r1';
+---------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@localhost                     |
+---------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`localhost`      |
| GRANT SELECT ON `db1`.* TO `u1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `r1`@`%`,`r2`@`%` TO `u1`@`localhost` |
+---------------------------------------------+
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u1'@'localhost' USING 'r2';
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@localhost                                     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`localhost`                      |
| GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `db1`.* TO `u1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `r1`@`%`,`r2`@`%` TO `u1`@`localhost`                 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u1'@'localhost' USING 'r1', 'r2';
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@localhost                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`localhost`                              |
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `db1`.* TO `u1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `r1`@`%`,`r2`@`%` TO `u1`@`localhost`                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

*Note*:

A privilege granted to an account is always in effect, but a role is
not. The active roles for an account can differ across and within
sessions, depending on the value of the activate_all_roles_on_login
system variable, the account default roles, and whether SET ROLE has
been executed within a session.

MySQL 8.0.16 and higher supports partial revokes of global privileges,
such that a global privilege can be restricted from applying to
particular schemas (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partial-revokes.html). To
indicate which global schema privileges have been revoked for
particular schemas, SHOW GRANTS output includes REVOKE statements:

mysql> SET PERSIST partial_revokes = ON;
mysql> CREATE USER u1;
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON mysql.* FROM u1;
mysql> REVOKE DELETE ON world.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`  |
| REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%` |
| REVOKE DELETE ON `world`.* FROM `u1`@`%`         |
+--------------------------------------------------+

SHOW GRANTS does not display privileges that are available to the named
account but are granted to a different account. For example, if an
anonymous account exists, the named account might be able to use its
privileges, but SHOW GRANTS does not display them.

An alternative to tbl_name FROM db_name syntax is db_name.tbl_name.
These two statements are equivalent:

SHOW INDEX FROM mytable FROM mydb;
SHOW INDEX FROM mydb.mytable;

The optional EXTENDED keyword causes the output to include information
about hidden indexes that MySQL uses internally and are not accessible
by users.

The WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more general
conditions, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extended-show.html.

SHOW INDEX returns the following fields:

o Table

  The name of the table.

o Non_unique

  0 if the index cannot contain duplicates, 1 if it can.

o Key_name

  The name of the index. If the index is the primary key, the name is
  always PRIMARY.

o Seq_in_index

  The column sequence number in the index, starting with 1.

o Column_name

  The column name. See also the description for the Expression column.

o Collation

  How the column is sorted in the index. This can have values A
  (ascending), D (descending), or NULL (not sorted).

o Cardinality

  An estimate of the number of unique values in the index. To update
  this number, run ANALYZE TABLE or (for MyISAM tables) myisamchk -a.

  Cardinality is counted based on statistics stored as integers, so the
  value is not necessarily exact even for small tables. The higher the
  cardinality, the greater the chance that MySQL uses the index when
  doing joins.

o Sub_part

  The index prefix. That is, the number of indexed characters if the
  column is only partly indexed, NULL if the entire column is indexed.

  *Note*:

  Prefix limits are measured in bytes. However, prefix lengths for
  index specifications in CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and CREATE INDEX
  statements are interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary
  string types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT) and number of bytes for binary
  string types (BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB). Take this into account when
  specifying a prefix length for a nonbinary string column that uses a
  multibyte character set.

  For additional information about index prefixes, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/column-indexes.html, and
  [HELP CREATE INDEX].

o Packed

  Indicates how the key is packed. NULL if it is not.

o Null

  Contains YES if the column may contain NULL values and '' if not.

o Index_type

  The index method used (BTREE, FULLTEXT, HASH, RTREE).

o Comment

  Information about the index not described in its own column, such as
  disabled if the index is disabled.

o Index_comment

  Any comment provided for the index with a COMMENT attribute when the
  index was created.

o Visible

  Whether the index is visible to the optimizer. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/invisible-indexes.html.

o Expression

  MySQL 8.0.13 and higher supports functional key parts (see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-inde
  x-functional-key-parts), which affects both the Column_name and
  Expression columns:

  o For a nonfunctional key part, Column_name indicates the column
    indexed by the key part and Expression is NULL.

  o For a functional key part, Column_name column is NULL and
    Expression indicates the expression for the key part.

Information about table indexes is also available from the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA STATISTICS table. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/statistics-table.html. The
extended information about hidden indexes is available only using SHOW
EXTENDED INDEX; it cannot be obtained from the STATISTICS table.

You can list a table's indexes with the mysqlshow -k db_name tbl_name
command.

661,SHOW PROCEDURE CODE,3,"Syntax:
SHOW PROCEDURE CODE proc_name

This statement is a MySQL extension that is available only for servers
that have been built with debugging support. It displays a
representation of the internal implementation of the named stored
procedure. A similar statement, SHOW FUNCTION CODE, displays
information about stored functions (see [HELP SHOW FUNCTION CODE]).

To use either statement, you must have the global SELECT privilege.

If the named routine is available, each statement produces a result
set. Each row in the result set corresponds to one ""instruction"" in the
routine. The first column is Pos, which is an ordinal number beginning
with 0. The second column is Instruction, which contains an SQL
statement (usually changed from the original source), or a directive
which has meaning only to the stored-routine handler.

SHOW PROCESSLIST shows which threads are running. If you have the
PROCESS privilege, you can see all threads. Otherwise, you can see only
your own threads (that is, threads associated with the MySQL account
that you are using). If you do not use the FULL keyword, only the first

    ALL
  | BLOCK IO
  | CONTEXT SWITCHES

}

The SHOW PROFILE and SHOW PROFILES statements display profiling
information that indicates resource usage for statements executed
during the course of the current session.

*Note*:

The SHOW PROFILE and SHOW PROFILES statements are deprecated and will
be removed in a future MySQL release. Use the Performance Schema
instead; see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-query-profil
ing.html.

To control profiling, use the profiling session variable, which has a
default value of 0 (OFF). Enable profiling by setting profiling to 1 or
ON:

mysql> SET profiling = 1;

SHOW PROFILES displays a list of the most recent statements sent to the
server. The size of the list is controlled by the
profiling_history_size session variable, which has a default value of
15. The maximum value is 100. Setting the value to 0 has the practical
effect of disabling profiling.

All statements are profiled except SHOW PROFILE and SHOW PROFILES, so
you will find neither of those statements in the profile list.
Malformed statements are profiled. For example, SHOW PROFILING is an
illegal statement, and a syntax error occurs if you try to execute it,
but it will show up in the profiling list.

SHOW PROFILE displays detailed information about a single statement.
Without the FOR QUERY n clause, the output pertains to the most
recently executed statement. If FOR QUERY n is included, SHOW PROFILE
displays information for statement n. The values of n correspond to the
Query_ID values displayed by SHOW PROFILES.

The LIMIT row_count clause may be given to limit the output to
row_count rows. If LIMIT is given, OFFSET offset may be added to begin
the output offset rows into the full set of rows.

By default, SHOW PROFILE displays Status and Duration columns. The
Status values are like the State values displayed by SHOW PROCESSLIST,
although there might be some minor differences in interpretion for the
two statements for some status values (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/thread-information.html).

Optional type values may be specified to display specific additional
types of information:

o ALL displays all information

o BLOCK IO displays counts for block input and output operations

o CONTEXT SWITCHES displays counts for voluntary and involuntary
  context switches

o CPU displays user and system CPU usage times

o IPC displays counts for messages sent and received

o MEMORY is not currently implemented

o PAGE FAULTS displays counts for major and minor page faults

o SOURCE displays the names of functions from the source code, together
  with the name and line number of the file in which the function
  occurs

o SWAPS displays swap counts

Profiling is enabled per session. When a session ends, its profiling
information is lost.

SHOW SLAVE HOSTS should be executed on a server that acts as a
replication master. The statement displays information about servers
that are or have been connected as replication slaves, with each row of
the result corresponding to one slave server, as shown here:

o Server_id: The unique server ID of the slave server, as configured in
  the slave server's option file, or on the command line with
  --server-id=value.

o Host: The host name of the slave server as specified on the slave
  with the --report-host option. This can differ from the machine name
  as configured in the operating system.

o User: The slave server user name as, specified on the slave with the
  --report-user option. Statement output includes this column only if
  the master server is started with the --show-slave-auth-info option.

o Password: The slave server password as, specified on the slave with
  the --report-password option. Statement output includes this column
  only if the master server is started with the --show-slave-auth-info
  option.

o Port: The port on the master to which the slave server is listening,
  as specified on the slave with the --report-port option.

  A zero in this column means that the slave port (--report-port) was
  not set.

o Master_id: The unique server ID of the master server that the slave
  server is replicating from. This is the server ID of the server on
  which SHOW SLAVE HOSTS is executed, so this same value is listed for
  each row in the result.

o Slave_UUID: The globally unique ID of this slave, as generated on the
  slave and found in the slave's auto.cnf file.

668,SHOW SLAVE STATUS,3,"Syntax:
SHOW SLAVE STATUS [FOR CHANNEL channel]

This statement provides status information on essential parameters of
the slave threads. It requires either the SUPER or REPLICATION CLIENT
privilege.

SHOW SLAVE STATUS is nonblocking. When run concurrently with STOP
SLAVE, SHOW SLAVE STATUS returns without waiting for STOP SLAVE to
finish shutting down the slave SQL thread or slave I/O thread (or
both). This permits use in monitoring and other applications where
getting an immediate response from SHOW SLAVE STATUS more important
than ensuring that it returned the latest data.

If you issue this statement using the mysql client, you can use a \G
statement terminator rather than a semicolon to obtain a more readable
vertical layout:

SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION] STATUS
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]

SHOW STATUS provides server status information (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html).
This statement does not require any privilege. It requires only the
ability to connect to the server.

Status variable information is also available from these sources:

o Performance Schema tables. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-status-var
  iable-tables.html.

o The mysqladmin extended-status command. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqladmin.html.

For SHOW STATUS, a LIKE clause, if present, indicates which variable
names to match. A WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more
general conditions, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extended-show.html.

SHOW STATUS accepts an optional GLOBAL or SESSION variable scope
modifier:

o With a GLOBAL modifier, the statement displays the global status
  values. A global status variable may represent status for some aspect
  of the server itself (for example, Aborted_connects), or the
  aggregated status over all connections to MySQL (for example,
  Bytes_received and Bytes_sent). If a variable has no global value,
  the session value is displayed.

o With a SESSION modifier, the statement displays the status variable
  values for the current connection. If a variable has no session
  value, the global value is displayed. LOCAL is a synonym for SESSION.

o If no modifier is present, the default is SESSION.

The scope for each status variable is listed at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html.

Each invocation of the SHOW STATUS statement uses an internal temporary
table and increments the global Created_tmp_tables value.

With a LIKE clause, the statement displays only rows for those
variables with names that match the pattern:

mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Key%';
+--------------------+----------+
| Variable_name      | Value    |
+--------------------+----------+

SHOW TABLE STATUS works likes SHOW TABLES, but provides a lot of
information about each non-TEMPORARY table. You can also get this list
using the mysqlshow --status db_name command. The LIKE clause, if

    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]

SHOW TABLES lists the non-TEMPORARY tables in a given database. You can
also get this list using the mysqlshow db_name command. The LIKE
clause, if present, indicates which table names to match. The WHERE
clause can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as
discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extended-show.html.

Matching performed by the LIKE clause is dependent on the setting of
the lower_case_table_names system variable.

The optional EXTENDED modifier causes SHOW TABLES to list hidden tables
created by failed ALTER TABLE statements. These temporary tables have
names beginning with #sql and can be dropped using DROP TABLE.

This statement also lists any views in the database. The optional FULL
modifier causes SHOW TABLES to display a second output column with
values of BASE TABLE for a table, VIEW for a view, or SYSTEM VIEW for
an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.

If you have no privileges for a base table or view, it does not show up
in the output from SHOW TABLES or mysqlshow db_name.

statement returns results only for databases and tables for which you
have the TRIGGER privilege. The LIKE clause, if present, indicates
which table names (not trigger names) to match and causes the statement

    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]

SHOW VARIABLES shows the values of MySQL system variables (see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html).
This statement does not require any privilege. It requires only the
ability to connect to the server.

System variable information is also available from these sources:

o Performance Schema tables. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-system-var
  iable-tables.html.

o The mysqladmin variables command. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqladmin.html.

For SHOW VARIABLES, a LIKE clause, if present, indicates which variable
names to match. A WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more
general conditions, as discussed in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extended-show.html.

SHOW VARIABLES accepts an optional GLOBAL or SESSION variable scope
modifier:

o With a GLOBAL modifier, the statement displays global system variable
  values. These are the values used to initialize the corresponding
  session variables for new connections to MySQL. If a variable has no
  global value, no value is displayed.

o With a SESSION modifier, the statement displays the system variable
  values that are in effect for the current connection. If a variable
  has no session value, the global value is displayed. LOCAL is a
  synonym for SESSION.

o If no modifier is present, the default is SESSION.

The scope for each system variable is listed at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html.

SHOW VARIABLES is subject to a version-dependent display-width limit.
For variables with very long values that are not completely displayed,
use SELECT as a workaround. For example:

SELECT @@GLOBAL.innodb_data_file_path;

Most system variables can be set at server startup (read-only variables
such as version_comment are exceptions). Many can be changed at runtime
with the SET statement. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/using-system-variables.html,
and [HELP SET].

With a LIKE clause, the statement displays only rows for those
variables with names that match the pattern. To obtain the row for a
specific variable, use a LIKE clause as shown:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';

To get a list of variables whose name match a pattern, use the %
wildcard character in a LIKE clause:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';

Wildcard characters can be used in any position within the pattern to
be matched. Strictly speaking, because _ is a wildcard that matches any
single character, you should escape it as \_ to match it literally. In
practice, this is rarely necessary.

674,SHOW WARNINGS,3,"Syntax:
SHOW WARNINGS [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
SHOW COUNT(*) WARNINGS

SHOW WARNINGS is a diagnostic statement that displays information about
the conditions (errors, warnings, and notes) resulting from executing a
statement in the current session. Warnings are generated for DML
statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and LOAD DATA as well as DDL
statements such as CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE.

The LIMIT clause has the same syntax as for the SELECT statement. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html.

SHOW WARNINGS is also used following EXPLAIN, to display the extended
information generated by EXPLAIN. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/explain-extended.html.

SHOW WARNINGS displays information about the conditions resulting from
execution of the most recent nondiagnostic statement in the current
session. If the most recent statement resulted in an error during
parsing, SHOW WARNINGS shows the resulting conditions, regardless of
statement type (diagnostic or nondiagnostic).

The SHOW COUNT(*) WARNINGS diagnostic statement displays the total
number of errors, warnings, and notes. You can also retrieve this
number from the warning_count system variable:

SHOW COUNT(*) WARNINGS;
SELECT @@warning_count;

A difference in these statements is that the first is a diagnostic
statement that does not clear the message list. The second, because it
is a SELECT statement is considered nondiagnostic and does clear the
message list.

A related diagnostic statement, SHOW ERRORS, shows only error
conditions (it excludes warnings and notes), and SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS
statement displays the total number of errors. See [HELP SHOW ERRORS].
GET DIAGNOSTICS can be used to examine information for individual
conditions. See [HELP GET DIAGNOSTICS].

675,BINLOG,3,"Syntax:
BINLOG 'str'

BINLOG is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the mysqlbinlog
program as the printable representation of certain events in binary log
files. (See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlbinlog.html.)
The 'str' value is a base 64-encoded string the that server decodes to
determine the data change indicated by the corresponding event.

To execute BINLOG statements when applying mysqlbinlog output, a user
account requires the BINLOG_ADMIN or SUPER privilege, or the
REPLICATION_APPLIER privilege plus the appropriate privileges to
execute each log event.

tbl_index_list:
  tbl_name [{INDEX|KEY} (index_name[, index_name] ...)]

partition_list: {
    partition_name[, partition_name] ...
  | ALL
}

The CACHE INDEX statement assigns table indexes to a specific key
cache. It applies only to MyISAM tables, including partitioned MyISAM
tables. After the indexes have been assigned, they can be preloaded
into the cache if desired with LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE.

The following statement assigns indexes from the tables t1, t2, and t3
to the key cache named hot_cache:

mysql> CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;

    TABLES
  | TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...
  | TABLES WITH READ LOCK
  | TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK
  | TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... FOR EXPORT
}

The FLUSH statement has several variant forms that clear or reload
various internal caches, flush tables, or acquire locks. To execute
FLUSH, you must have the RELOAD privilege. Specific flush options might
require additional privileges, as described later.

*Note*:

It is not possible to issue FLUSH statements within stored functions or
triggers. However, you may use FLUSH in stored procedures, so long as
these are not called from stored functions or triggers. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-program-restrictions.htm
l.

By default, the server writes FLUSH statements to the binary log so
that they replicate to replication slaves. To suppress logging, specify
the optional NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword or its alias LOCAL.

*Note*:

FLUSH LOGS, FLUSH BINARY LOGS, FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK (with or
without a table list), and FLUSH TABLES tbl_name ... FOR EXPORT are not
written to the binary log in any case because they would cause problems
if replicated to a slave.

The FLUSH statement causes an implicit commit. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

The mysqladmin utility provides a command-line interface to some flush
operations, using commands such as flush-hosts, flush-logs,
flush-privileges, flush-status, and flush-tables. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqladmin.html.

Sending a SIGHUP signal to the server causes several flush operations
to occur that are similar to various forms of the FLUSH statement. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-signal-response.html.

The RESET statement is similar to FLUSH. See [HELP RESET], for
information about using the RESET statement with replication.

678,KILL,3,"Syntax:
KILL [CONNECTION | QUERY] processlist_id

Each connection to mysqld runs in a separate thread. You can kill a
thread with the KILL processlist_id statement.

Thread processlist identifiers can be determined from the ID column of
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST table, the Id column of SHOW
PROCESSLIST output, and the PROCESSLIST_ID column of the Performance
Schema threads table. The value for the current thread is returned by
the CONNECTION_ID() function.

KILL permits an optional CONNECTION or QUERY modifier:

o KILL CONNECTION is the same as KILL with no modifier: It terminates
  the connection associated with the given processlist_id, after
  terminating any statement the connection is executing.

o KILL QUERY terminates the statement the connection is currently
  executing, but leaves the connection itself intact.

The ability to see which threads are available to be killed depends on
the PROCESS privilege:

o Without PROCESS, you can see only your own threads.

o With PROCESS, you can see all threads.

The ability to kill threads and statements depends on the
CONNECTION_ADMIN and SUPER privileges:

o Without CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER, you can kill only your own threads
  and statements.

o With CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER, you can kill all threads and
  statements, except that to affect a thread or statement that is
  executing with the SYSTEM_USER privilege, your own session must
  additionally have the SYSTEM_USER privilege.

You can also use the mysqladmin processlist and mysqladmin kill
commands to examine and kill threads.

    [IGNORE LEAVES]

partition_list: {
    partition_name[, partition_name] ...
  | ALL
}

The LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE statement preloads a table index into the key
cache to which it has been assigned by an explicit CACHE INDEX
statement, or into the default key cache otherwise.

LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE applies only to MyISAM tables, including
partitioned MyISAM tables. In addition, indexes on partitioned tables
can be preloaded for one, several, or all partitions.

The IGNORE LEAVES modifier causes only blocks for the nonleaf nodes of
the index to be preloaded.

IGNORE LEAVES is also supported for partitioned MyISAM tables.

The RESET statement is used to clear the state of various server
operations. You must have the RELOAD privilege to execute RESET.

For information about the RESET PERSIST statement that removes
persisted global system variables, see [HELP RESET PERSIST].

RESET acts as a stronger version of the FLUSH statement. See [HELP
FLUSH].

The RESET statement causes an implicit commit. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html.

The following list describes the permitted RESET statement reset_option
values:

o RESET MASTER

  Deletes all binary logs listed in the index file, resets the binary
  log index file to be empty, and creates a new binary log file.

o RESET SLAVE

  Makes the slave forget its replication position in the master binary
  logs. Also resets the relay log by deleting any existing relay log
  files and beginning a new one.

681,RESET PERSIST,3,"Syntax:
RESET PERSIST [[IF EXISTS] system_var_name]

RESET PERSIST removes persisted global system variable settings from
the mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data directory. Removing a
persisted system variable causes the variable no longer to be
initialized from mysqld-auto.cnf at server startup. For more
information about persisting system variables and the mysqld-auto.cnf
file, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/persisted-system-variables.html
.

The privileges required for RESET PERSIST depend on the type of system
variable to be removed:

o For dynamic system variables, this statement requires the
  SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.

o For read-only system variables, this statement requires the
  SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN privileges.

See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/system-variable-privileges.html
.

Depending on whether the variable name and IF EXISTS clauses are
present, the RESET PERSIST statement has these forms:

o To remove all persisted variables from mysqld-auto.cnf, use RESET
  PERSIST without naming any system variable:

RESET PERSIST;

  You must have privileges for removing both dynamic and read-only
  system variables if mysqld-auto.cnf contains both kinds of variables.

o To remove a specific persisted variable from mysqld-auto.cnf, name it
  in the statement:

RESET PERSIST system_var_name;

  This includes plugin system variables, even if the plugin is not
  currently installed. If the variable is not present in the file, an
  error occurs.

o To remove a specific persisted variable from mysqld-auto.cnf, but
  produce a warning rather than an error if the variable is not present
  in the file, add an IF EXISTS clause to the previous syntax:

RESET PERSIST IF EXISTS system_var_name;

682,RESTART,3,"Syntax:
RESTART

This statement stops and restarts the MySQL server. It requires the
SHUTDOWN privilege.

One use for RESTART is when it is not possible or convenient to gain
command-line access to the MySQL server on the server host to restart
it. For example, SET PERSIST_ONLY can be used at runtime to make
configuration changes to system variables that can be set only at
server startup, but the server must still be restarted for those
changes to take effect. The RESTART statement provides a way to do so
from within client sessions, without requiring command-line access on
the server host.

*Note*:

After executing a RESTART statement, the client can expect the current
connection to be lost. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the connection
will be reestablished after the server restarts. Otherwise, the
connection must be reestablished manually.

A successful RESTART operation requires mysqld to be running in an
environment that has a monitoring process available to detect a server
shutdown performed for restart purposes:

o In the presence of a monitoring process, RESTART causes mysqld to
  terminate such that the monitoring process can determine that it
  should start a new mysqld instance.

o If no monitoring process is present, RESTART fails with an error.

These platforms provide the necessary monitoring support for the
RESTART statement:

o Windows, when mysqld is started as a Windows service or standalone.
  (mysqld forks, and one process acts as a monitor to the other, which
  acts as the server.)

o Unix and Unix-like systems that use systemd or mysqld_safe to manage
  mysqld.

To configure a monitoring environment such that mysqld enables the
RESTART statement:

1. Set the MYSQLD_PARENT_PID environment variable to the value of the
   process ID of the process that starts mysqld, before starting
   mysqld.

2. When mysqld performs a shutdown due to use of the RESTART statement,
   it returns exit code 16.

3. When the monitoring process detects an exit code of 16, it starts
   mysqld again. Otherwise, it exits.

Here is a minimal example as implemented in the bash shell:

#!/bin/bash

export MYSQLD_PARENT_PID=$$

export MYSQLD_RESTART_EXIT=16

while true ; do
  bin/mysqld mysqld options here
  if [ $? -ne $MYSQLD_RESTART_EXIT ]; then
    break
  fi
done

On Windows, the forking used to implement RESTART makes determining the
server process to attach to for debugging more difficult. To alleviate
this, starting the server with --gdb suppresses forking, in addition to
its other actions done to set up a debugging environment. In non-debug
settings, --no-monitor may be used for the sole purpose of suppressing
forking the monitor process. For a server started with either --gdb or
--no-monitor, executing RESTART causes the server to simply exit
without restarting.
